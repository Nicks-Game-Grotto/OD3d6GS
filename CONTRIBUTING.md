# Contributing to OD3d6GS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Open Development 3d6 Game System (OD3d6GS)** and the collaborative campaign setting **Stereotera**. This project thrives on the creativity, talent, and passion of its contributors. Below, you'll find guidelines on how you can contribute and the goals driving this project.

I am the creator and visionary for **OD3d6GS** and **Stereotera**. My role is to shepherd the system’s development, document its history, and ensure its growth reflects the community’s creative efforts. I am focused on creating the proprietary Death Mesa campaign setting, where gameplay events shape its evolving lore. I want to enable others to take leadership roles in promoting, organizing, and enhancing this project as it grows.

## Goals of the Project

- **Innovate TTRPG Design**: To redefine how people play and think about tabletop RPGs through a community-driven, open-development game system.
- **Foster Creativity**: Build **Stereotera**, a shared universe that grows organically through the collective imagination of its contributors, akin to SCP or Creepypasta.
- **Establish Canon Through Collaboration**: Allow GMs and players to branch the repository, develop unique campaigns, and vote on what becomes main-branch canon for the Stereotera setting.
- **Support Fair Play and Fair Pay**: Ensure contributors receive recognition and equitable shares of any profits generated from their work.

**OD3d6GS** is made available under an open license for development and innovation, while **Death Mesa**, a proprietary setting, evolves through gameplay, with player characters credited for contributions to the lore.
