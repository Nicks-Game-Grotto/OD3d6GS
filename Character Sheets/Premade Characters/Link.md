# Link

# Archetype

Link is the embodiment of a Wood Elf’s connection to nature, his lean but muscular build honed from years of climbing trees and navigating the forests of Faron. His skin carries a sun-kissed hue, the result of countless hours spent outdoors, and his tousled, sandy-blond hair falls messily just above his shoulders, often pushed out of his piercing green eyes. His youthful face holds a quiet determination, but also the calm of someone who feels at home in the wild.

He dresses in practical, forest-colored tunics—greens and browns that blend with the natural world around him—made of durable but lightweight materials for ease of movement. His leather boots are scuffed from countless journeys, and his forearms are wrapped in bracers, though his armor is understated and flexible, designed for speed rather than defense. At his side is a simple but finely-crafted sword, and a wooden shield adorned with symbols of his village. Link’s entire demeanor speaks of agility, readiness, and quiet confidence—a warrior molded by nature and prepared for whatever lies ahead.

# Thoughts

## Link’s Thoughts on Becoming Zelda’s Champion

It still seems unreal sometimes—standing at Zelda’s side as her Champion, the one chosen to protect her and all of Hyrule. I never imagined I’d be here. Growing up in Faron, deep in the forest, I didn’t think of grand tournaments or royal titles. My world was simpler, quieter, and smaller. But that world shaped me in ways I didn’t fully understand until much later.

The forests around Faron taught me more than just how to track animals. They taught me to notice the things most people overlook—the way a bird takes flight just before a storm, the way leaves tremble when a predator’s near, or how a single branch, low and sturdy, can be your lifeline when you’re climbing higher than you ever have before. That perception, the ability to read the world around me, was something I didn’t even realize I was learning as a boy. It’s what made me good at moving through the trees unnoticed, and why I could feel a change in the air before it happened. I never thought much of it until the day I entered that competition.

It was Uncle Alrek who convinced me to go. He was always encouraging me to do more than just roam the woods. He wanted me to see the world outside our village, beyond the trees. I didn’t really want to leave Faron, but the tournament was being held just a few miles from home, in Ordun. The Ordun Games, they called it. It was nothing fancy—more like a gathering of village folk testing their strength and skill for a few days of excitement. I didn’t expect to compete seriously, let alone win anything. But Uncle Alrek had other plans.

I remember standing there, watching the others—men twice my size, knights in training, all showing off their strength with swords and shields I had never touched before. I was just a kid, barely old enough to hold a blade, let alone fight with one. But something happened when it was my turn. They handed me a shield, and it felt… natural. It was as if I’d been holding one my whole life. The weight of it, the way it balanced in my arm—it didn’t feel strange or awkward. The same with the sword. I remember swinging it and thinking, I shouldn’t know how to do this, but I did.

I wasn’t the strongest in that competition, not by a long shot. But every movement felt right. Every block, every strike—it was like I was just remembering something buried deep inside me. The others fought with brute force, but I relied on something else, something that came from years of climbing trees, balancing on branches, and reacting to the forest around me. My reflexes, my awareness—those were the things that gave me an edge.

And then, I won. Somehow, against all odds, I won the Ordun Games. I remember the shock on my uncle’s face when they announced it. I think he was more surprised than I was. But the real shock came later, when word of my victory reached Hyrule Castle, and they invited me to the royal tournament. That’s when everything changed. I went from a boy of the forest to a contender for the greatest honor in the kingdom.

Even now, after all these years, I still wonder why it felt so natural—wielding weapons I had never touched, fighting battles I had never trained for. Maybe it’s just luck, or maybe there’s something else, something I haven’t uncovered yet. Either way, I know the forest made me who I am. The same instincts that helped me climb the highest trees and listen to the world around me have carried me through every challenge since. And no matter how far this journey takes me from Faron, I’ll always carry that part of me—the part that sees, that moves, and that never stops reaching for the next branch.

## Link’s Got Feelings About Stuff?\!

Date: The Second Dawn of Autumn

Training is harder than I expected. I mean, sure, I always knew it would be tough. But the constant drills, sparring, and long hours with a sword in hand—it pushes me further than anything I’ve faced in the forests of Faron. Climbing trees and tracking wild animals gave me strength, no doubt, but being the Champion of Hyrule? That’s something else entirely.

Still, through all the bruises and exhaustion, there’s this strange sense of connection that keeps me going. I’ve known Zelda and Ganon for years, but the bond between us feels deeper than just those few memories of growing up together. It’s almost like we’re tied to something bigger than ourselves. We weren’t just thrown together by chance—there’s purpose here. Standing with Zelda, the Princess of Hyrule, and Ganon, the wizard’s apprentice, it feels like fate. Like everything in our lives has led to this moment.

But despite everything—the title, the weapons, the training—there’s one thing that always bugs me. Everyone seems to think I’m rich because of my gear. The armor, the weapons, the finely-made tunics… Sure, they look impressive, but they’re not mine. I didn’t pay for them. They’re just given to me by the castle, along with food and shelter. Sometimes, the villagers act like I’m some wealthy knight, but they don’t realize… I don’t have a single Rupee to my name\! They don’t pay me anything\!

Then again, maybe I shouldn’t complain. Everybody in the nearby villages knows me, respects me. People greet me warmly, offer me food without asking for anything in return. What more could I want, really? I’ve got everything I need—just not in the way most people think. At the end of the day, it’s not about the riches or the fame. It’s about the duty I took on when I became the Champion. And I wouldn’t trade that for anything.
