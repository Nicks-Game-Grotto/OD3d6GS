## Background:  
Hollalee Withrethen carries the weight of her family’s prestigious name, using it to influence deals and open doors despite being cut off financially. Her strained relationship with her family leaves her on the edge of high society, with some respecting her boldness while others heed the family’s warnings to avoid her. She maintains a reputation as a daring and charismatic figure, though her manipulative tendencies often create tension.
### Contacts:
**Ozzel Kintle** - Ozzel is a Marshfolk who runs a modest food cart near the docks, serving hearty stews and fried fish to sailors and dockworkers.
**Inessa Velaro** - Inessa is a Duststrider who operates a thriving tradehouse in Port Reckless, specializing in rare goods, magical curiosities, and high-value information.

## Heritage:
***Mixed Heritage** (Deep Elf 30%, Human 30%, Moon Elf 40%)*

Hollalee’s bloodline weaves a rich tapestry of Deep Elf, Human, and Moon Elf ancestry, giving her striking features and an innate connection to Vitalix energy. Three generations ago, her great-great-aunt, the infamous pirate queen Sorynne “Stormsong” Withrethen, ruled the seas before the formation of the Corsair Trade Corporation. Hollalee’s family believes she may be Sorynne’s reincarnated soul, a notion Hollalee embraces wholeheartedly. At the age of 65—barely an adult by elven standards—she left home to forge her own path, determined to reclaim her ancestor’s legacy and carve her name into history.
