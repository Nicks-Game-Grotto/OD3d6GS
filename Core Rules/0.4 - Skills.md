## Skills and Skill Groups

In this game system, there is an important distinction between **Skill Groups** and **Skills**. While Skill Groups unlock a range of actions, Skills are the specific abilities that must be tied to Abilities to be fully utilized. It is also important to understand that the terms Physical Mental and Spiritual as they are used in this document are for organizational purposes only, there are no intended requisite attribute relationships. A player is free to use a physical skill and tie it to a Spiritual or Mental skill and vice versa.

### Skill Groups

Skill Groups are broad, representing a range of related skills. When a player chooses a Skill Group, they gain access to all the related skills within that group for *out of combat saves* and creating *Abilities*. These are written on the character sheet as part of the Character Archetype or Supplemental Skills. You can use any skill from the group as if it were on your sheet during relevant challenges and ability creation for that Skill Group.

All skill groups are on the 3rd header level in the Table of Contents.

**Example of how skill groups work:**

A character with the **Athletics** group can perform **Climbing** or **Sprinting** challenges as if those skills were on their sheet.

Choosing a Skill Group is a powerful choice because it gives you access to many related skills that can be used freely for challenges. However, these skills do not automatically carry over to combat abilities unless they are tied to specific abilities.

### Specific Skills

A Skill is the specific narrowly defined skills that appear on your character sheet. They are tied directly to your character’s Learning, Preparation, or Heritage. Specific skills need to be selected or unlocked through character creation or progression.

- **Skill Name**: Short description of the skill. This is how skills are formatted below.

**Example of how skills work:**

If a player wants to imbue their weapon with fire during combat, they need the **Imbue Element (Fire)** skill. This is not a general group but a specific skill. The player must tie this skill to an ability, typically through Learning, Preparation, or Innately as a Heritage Skill.

Unlike Skill Groups, specific skills cannot be used as freely. They require direct integration into the character’s abilities. If a skill is not tied to your Archetype, Heritage, or a Supplemental Skill, you cannot use it as part of your Archetype Abilities. This means that Abilities created from these skills will receive To Hit and Damage bonuses based on the associated Skill and Attribute which might be different from the Archetype Bonus.

**Example of combining skills:**

Imagine a player wants to be a **Weapon Master** for their Archetype. They can choose the **Skirmisher** and **Archery** Skill Groups. The player can use these for challenges that involve using these weapons and will likely use the Archetype Bonus To Hit and Archetype Attribute Bonus added to Damage. In other words, a Weapon Master can pick up and use any weapon on the Skirmisher and Archery as their Archetype.

However, if the same player wants to imbue their sword with fire during combat, they need to select the specific skill **Imbue Element (Fire)**. This skill must be tied to an Ability. If **Imbue Element (Fire)** comes from their Heritage or has an appropriately high Skill Mastery Level, they can connect it to their Archetype, allowing them to apply bonuses from their Archetype. If not, the skill cannot be used freely in combat without spending or maintaining effort and does not roll with the Archetype Bonus until the character's Skill Mastery reaches the appropriate Level.

### Summary

- **Skill Groups** give you broad access to related skills for challenges but do not always automatically apply to Archetype.  
- **Skills** are specific actions that must be tied to abilities through Archetype, Heritage, or Supplemental Skills to be fully effective.

The flexibility of **Skill Groups** is powerful and broadly applied, while **Skills** provide focused abilities. Both require advancement to get more powerful abilities.

### Archery

Archery represents the art of long-range precision, focusing on skill, patience, and a keen eye. Skilled archers excel at striking distant targets with remarkable accuracy, combining Focus, Dexterity, and Steady Aim to take advantage of positioning, terrain, and timing. Unlike close combatants, archers engage from afar, allowing them to assess the battlefield and select targets strategically, often before their opponents can react. Whether using a bow to pick off foes from cover, supporting allies from the rear, or hunting in rugged wilderness, archers prioritize sharp reflexes, spatial awareness, and control over their weapons.

**Armor and Shields**
Proficient in medium armor, archers prioritize a blend of mobility and durability, allowing them to stay protected from close-range threats while still moving efficiently to find advantageous positions. The use of greatshields provides a substantial defense against incoming projectiles, as these shields can be deployed on the ground with a stand to create a fortified position. While cumbersome to set up and reposition, greatshields offer reliable cover, giving archers the confidence to hold their ground in the heat of battle, fire with precision from a secure stance, and reposition strategically as the fight demands.

**Tactical Awareness**
Archers excel at surveying the battlefield, using keen observational skills to find ideal vantage points and control the distance between themselves and their opponents. In adventuring, they employ precision and patience, often scouting ahead to spot potential dangers before they escalate. When setting traps or preparing ambushes, their strategic positioning can make the difference in swiftly neutralizing threats. In warfare, archers thrive when supporting allies from afar, delivering a barrage of arrows to disrupt enemy formations or cover the advance or retreat of their forces.

## Forces and Forms

Magic in this system is divided into three fundamental forces: **Vitalix** (Life Body), **Vidhix** (Void Mind), and **Manix** (Energy Spirit). Each force manifests through five unique forms, collectively described by the suffix “mancy,” representing the magical manipulation of various elements or energies. These forms encompass a wide range of abilities, from the control of living and physical matter to the harnessing of void or spiritual energy, offering diverse paths for spellcasters to explore and master.

In this system, the three magic forces—Vitalix, Vidhix, and Manix—serve as foundational elements that shape the way magic users channel their abilities. These forces cannot be directly listed as skills on a character sheet, but their influence is fundamental to how magic manifests. Each force breaks down into five Forms, which are treated as skill categories in character creation.

Characters may select a Form as an **Archetype**, **Supplemental**, or **Heritage** Skill (limit one Heritage Skill if a Form is chosen), investing in it to gain specialized or more potent abilities tied to that Form. Any character, regardless of their chosen Form, can still cast spells from all three forces but may lack the innate mastery of those who specialize in a particular path.

#### Vidhix Forms

- **Geomancy**: Manipulation of earth, rock, and minerals. Geomancers reshape landscapes, summon earthquakes, or divine wisdom from the shifting of stones.
