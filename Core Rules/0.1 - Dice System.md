# Dice System

The ODGS is A 3d6 system. Rolling three six sided dice works well for TTRPGs because it makes mid-range results (10-11) common and extreme results (3 or 18) rare. This ensures that character competence plays a bigger role than sheer randomness, creating more consistent outcomes. When rolling under an ability save score for voluntary actions, skilled characters succeed more reliably, while unskilled characters struggle appropriately. This adds a sense of realism and balance, rewarding players for investing in their stats.

In opposed checks, where one character rolls over a target’s ability save score plus a modifier, the system maintains a fair challenge. Since most rolls cluster around the middle values, small differences in ability scores matter more, making every stat point valuable. This leads to more predictable yet meaningful variance, ensuring that characters perform within expectations rather than facing wild, swingy outcomes like in a d20 system. The result is a game that feels balanced, strategic, and rewarding, with players having a clearer sense of their odds.

## Rolling 3d6 for Challenges

Success is determined by meeting the required number, whether rolling for a Save or Voluntary Save. If the roll matches the target number the challenge is successfully overcome.

- **Saves**: Succeed when the sum of the dice rolled, plus relevant skill and attribute modifiers, meets or exceeds the challenge’s Save Score.  
- **Voluntary Saves**: Succeed when the sum of the dice rolled meets or falls below the character’s Save Score.

### Saves (Forced Challenges)

Saves occur when external forces or difficulty beyond the character's ability push a character into a situation beyond their control. These challenges are resolved by rolling 3d6, adding relevant skill and attribute modifiers, and aiming to exceed a Save Score set by the GM.

**Example:**

A character falls off a cliff and must pull themselves up. They roll 3d6, add their **Strength** and **Heavy Lifting** modifiers, and attempt to exceed a Save Score of 15.
A character wants to create a restoration potion that has difficult instructions or dangerous ingredients. They roll 3d6, add their **Intuition** and **Scientific Understanding** modifiers, and attempt to exceed a Save Score of 15.

- **Roll Calculation**: 3d6 + Attribute + Skill = Total  
- If the total is **15 or greater**, the character succeeds.

**Summary:**

- Saves are active or reactive responses to external or difficult challenges.  
- Players must roll **above** a Save Score set by the GM.  
- These rolls represent circumstances where the character has limited control over the outcome.

### Voluntary Saves (Player-Driven Actions)

Voluntary Saves are proactive, occurring when characters attempt tasks within their expertise or control. These challenges are resolved by rolling 3d6 and aiming to roll **below** the character’s personal Save Score, which reflects their mastery of the task.

**Example:**

An athlete climbs a 15 foot tall wall. They roll 3d6 and attempt to roll under their Save Score of 14 (calculated as 8 + Agility 3 + Athletics 3).
An alchemist brews a familiar potion. They roll 3d6 and attempt to roll under their Save Score of 14 (calculated as 8 + Intuition 3 + Alchemy 3).

- **Roll Calculation**: 3d6 = Total  
- If the total is **14 or less**, the character succeeds.

**Summary:**

- Voluntary Saves represent proactive challenges where characters are in control.  
- Players must roll **at or below** their own Save Score.  
- These rolls apply to tasks the character has experience or mastery over.

#### Player Agency and Character Expertise

The system emphasizes player choice and character expertise:

- **Saves** are for reactive situations where the character faces external challenges.  
- **Voluntary Saves** empower players by relying on their character’s mastery and skill.

**Example Comparison:**

- A **Brute** falls off a cliff and must roll above a **Save Score** of 15 because climbing is not part of their expertise.  
- An **Athlete** with climbing skills can treat this same challenge as a Voluntary Save, rolling under their own Save Score instead.

### Dice Mechanics

- Roll **3d6** and add relevant skill and attribute modifiers. Often, this is your Archetype Bonus (AB).  
  - **Example**: A Brute with **Heavy Lifting 3** and **Strength 2** rolls 3d6 + 5 against a Save Score of 15.  
- If no relevant skill applies, add only the Attribute Modifier:  
  - **Example**: A Fighter with **Strength 3** rolls 3d6 + 3 against a Save Score of 15.  
- If no relevant attribute applies, add only the Domain Modifier:  
  - **Example**: A Mage with **Body -1** rolls 3d6 - 1 against a Save Score of 15.
- Compare the total to the Save Score, typically ranging from 12 to 25.

### Rolling with Advantage or Disadvantage: A Dice Pool System

The system uses a **dice pool** mechanic to handle advantage and disadvantage, allowing players to roll additional dice and choose the best or worst outcomes. For **Advantage** or **Disadvantage**, players adjust their dice pool by rolling **extra dice** and then choosing the **best** or **worst** three dice based on their situation. The system ensures fairness while maintaining the balance of stacking advantages or penalties.

#### Rolling with Advantage

Advantage allows players to add up to **three additional dice** to their roll (up to a maximum of **6d6** total) and choose the **best results**. This represents favorable circumstances or bonuses.

1. **Single Advantage**: Roll **1 extra die** (4d6 total); keep the highest **3 dice**.  
2. **Double Advantage**: Roll **2 extra dice** (5d6 total); keep the highest **3 dice**.  
3. **Triple Advantage**: Roll **3 extra dice** (6d6 total); keep the highest **3 dice**.

**Key Rules**:

- Advantage can stack from multiple sources but is capped at **Triple Advantage (6d6 total)**.  
- Players choose which 3 dice they take for the roll..

#### Rolling with Disadvantage

Disadvantage forces players to roll **additional dice** and choose the **worst three results**. This represents unfavorable circumstances or penalties. For **Double** or **Triple Disadvantage**, rolling Doubles or Triples do not count as hits and do not replenish effort.

1. **Single Disadvantage**: Roll **1 extra die** (4d6 total); keep the lowest **3 dice**.  
2. **Double Disadvantage**: Roll **2 extra dice** (5d6 total); keep the lowest **3 dice**.  
3. **Triple Disadvantage**: Roll **3 extra dice** (6d6 total); keep the lowest **3 dice**.

**Key Rules:**

- Disadvantage can stack from multiple sources but is capped at **Triple Disadvantage (6d6 total)**.  
- Always choose the **lowest three dice** from the total rolled.  
- Avoid taking doubles or triples, except for triple ones.

#### Rolling Doubles, Triples, and Criticals

##### Rolling Doubles

- **In Combat**: Gain temporary **Adrenaline Effort** equal to half the value of the third die rounded up.  
  - **Adrenaline Effort** can be **Spent** as **Stamina**, **Focus**, or **Resolve** and expires at the end of combat.  
  - Players may choose to count a rolled double as a **hit** instead of recharging their Effort pools.  
- **Outside Combat**: Gain **One** temporary **Inspiration Effort**.
  - **Inspiration Effort** can be **Spent** as **Stamina**, **Focus**, or **Resolve** and expires at the end of the session.

##### Rolling Triples (2-5)

Players succeed on their save automatically.

- **In Combat**: Gain **Adrenaline Effort** equal to the value of one die.  
  - The attack hits.  
  - **Adrenaline Effort** can be **Spent** as **Stamina**, **Focus**, or **Resolve** and expire at the end of combat.  
  - Add half the value of the total roll (rounded up) to the damage roll.  
- **Outside Combat**: Gain temporary **Inspiration Effort** equal to **double the value** of one die.  
  - **Inspiration Effort** can be **Spent** as **Stamina**, **Focus**, or **Resolve** and expires at the end of the session.

##### Rolling Triple Six

- **In Combat**: Trigger a **Critical Hit**, adding **+18** to the damage roll.  
- **Outside Combat**: All party members gain **3 Inspiration Points**.  
  - Players can sacrifice these points for an automatic success on the roll.

##### Rolling Triple One

- **Fail to Maintain Effort**: Burn Maintained Effort with no effect.  
- **In Combat**:  
  - **Fumble**: The GM may react with a counterattack that does not cost action points.  
  - The player becomes **Vulnerable** until the start of their next action.  
- **Outside Combat**:  
  - Automatically fail the check, rendering the task impossible for the party using similar means.  
  - **Note for GMs**: When a door closes, open a window. Even failed rolls should lead to new challenges or opportunities.
