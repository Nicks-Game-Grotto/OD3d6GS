## Understanding Abilities

In this game, Abilities represent the unique actions and powers your character can perform by using their Skills. Each Ability is tied to a character’s Effort, which reflects the physical, mental, or spiritual energy they expend to execute these actions. Abilities are the backbone of your character’s power, guiding how they leverage their skills in gameplay, especially in combat and challenges.

## Abilities and Effort

Every Ability is tied to one or more of your character’s Effort Points: **Stamina (Body)**, **Focus (Mind)**, or **Resolve (Spirit)**. These are limited resources your character uses to perform exceptional feats.

- **Maintaining Effort**: Some abilities require Maintained Effort, meaning the character must continuously focus or exert themselves to keep the ability active. For example, maintaining a defensive stance or holding a magical shield in place requires Maintained Effort. Players must define the Ability as Maintained Stamina, Focus, or Resolve, and can not maintain effort on more than one ability at a time.
- **Spending Effort**: Abilities that require Spent Effort are one-time actions, like a powerful attack or casting a spell. These cost effort points in the moment but don’t need to be maintained. Player's can Spend Adrenaline, Inspiration, or Domain Effort and can Spend Effort while Maintaining Effort.
- **Burning Effort**: Certain powerful abilities require you to Burn Effort. This represents pushing beyond your limits, performing extraordinary feats like executing a devastating combo attack or using magic to alter the environment. Burning Effort is often reserved for dramatic moments, as it depletes your reserves until you recover. Players must Burn Effort related to an associated Domain (Stamina, Focus, or Resolve)

## How Abilities Work

Abilities describe how your character uses the Skills during gameplay. Each Ability represents a unique way your character can combine their skills with effort to achieve powerful results.

**Example:**

- A Pyromancer might have an ability called *Flame Strike*, where they Spend Effort to summon a blast of fire, using their *Imbue Element (Fire)* skill. The player rolls dice and adds their Pyromancy skill and/or associated Attribute to determine how successful the ability is.  
- A Martial Artist might have an ability called *Defensive Stance*, requiring them to Maintain Effort to increase their defense and react swiftly with skills like *Parry* or *Counterstrike* during combat.  
- A Storyteller could have an ability like *Inspire Allies*, where they Burn Effort to give their teammates huge bonuses by using their *Mesmerism* or *Performance* skills.

### Tying Skills to Abilities

Each Ability your character uses is tied to a Skill or combination of skills. These skills define the range of actions your character can perform. When creating or using an ability, the skills you select dictate how you can apply your effort.

**For example:**

- A character with the Weapon Master Skill might create an ability like *Whirling Blades*, spending effort to attack multiple targets using *Dual Wielding* and *Swords*.  
- A character with the Summoner Skill might create an ability like *Summon Guardian Spirit*, maintaining effort to keep a summoned ally in the fight, using their *Summoning* and *Necromancy* skills.

Your character’s abilities give you direct control over how you express your skills in combat and challenges. When you create an ability, you decide which skills it uses, what kind of effort it requires, and how it functions during gameplay.

## Creating and Using Abilities

Abilities define what your character can do during gameplay. Players create their own abilities based on their Skills and Attributes, or select from pre-made ones associated with their chosen Skills.

### Gaining Abilities

You can gain new abilities related to a skill when you increase a skill to the **Novice (0)**, **Apprentice (1)**, **Adept (2)**, and **Skilled (3)** Skill Mastery Levels.

### Augmenting Abilities

Rather than gaining new abilities players can choose to augment an ability that they already have increasing it's damage output or range. Players can not change more than one stat at a time until they reach the Expert Mastery Level. (There are no rules for the Expert Augments yet.)

### Ability Creation Process

Abilities are the defining actions characters take during gameplay, customized based on their Skills, Attributes, and Effort. Follow the steps to create balanced and engaging Abilities:

#### **1. Define the Effort Type**

Choose an **Effort Type** based on the nature and cost of the ability:
- **Free Effort:** Simple actions that require no resource expenditure.
- **Maintained Effort:** Sustained abilities that require resolve, focus, or stamina to remain active. Maintained effort can be recovered, swapped, moved, or burned, but only one at a time.
- **Spent Effort:** One-time actions that consume effort for immediate effects. You can Spend Effort and Maintain Effort at the same time.
- **Burned Effort:** Powerful actions with lasting costs, you burn the effort that you are maintaining.

#### **2. Select the Associated Skill and Attribute**

Each ability must correspond to a **Skill** and its **Associated Attribute**:
- **Skill Mastery Level:** Influences the effectiveness and complexity of the ability.  
  - Novice (0): Gain an ability.  
  - Apprentice (1): Gain or Augment an ability.
  - Adept (2): Gain or Augment further.
  - Skilled (3): Gain or Augment further. 
- **Attribute Score:** Contributes directly to **To Hit**, **Save**, and other calculations.

#### **3. Determine ToHit and Save**

**ToHit Calculation:**  
  \[
  \text{ToHit} = \text{Skill Mastery Level} + \text{Attribute Score}
  \]
**Save DC Calculation:**  
  \[
  \text{Save DC} = 8 + \text{Skill Mastery Level} + \text{Attribute Score}
  \]

#### **4. Set the Damage or Effect**

- Use the **Damage Dice Scale** to determine the damage or effect size based on **Skill Mastery** or **Weapon Size**.

#### **5. Define the Range**

Choose an appropriate range for the ability using the document **Combat & Movement Ranges**:

- Examples:
  - Very Close: Melee or personal abilities.
  - Close: Short-range abilities like a tackle or spear weapon.
  - Medium/Short: Spells or ranged attacks.
  - Aura: Radial effects centered on the character.

#### **6. Specify the Shape of Magic (if applicable)**

For magical abilities, specify the **Shape**:

- Examples:
  - **Blast:** Single-target, concentrated effect.
  - **Bolt:** Projectile effect.
  - **Aura:** Area-of-effect around the caster.

#### **7. Write the Description**

Create a concise but flavorful description that includes:

- **Effort Type.**
- **ToHit or Save.**
- **Effect and Range.**
- **Conditions or Themes:** Integrate conditions (*Distracted*, *Frightened*).

**Example:**  
> **Entropic Touch** (Free Effort, +6 ToHit, 3d3+3, Very Close)  
> A concentrated Blast of Vitalix energy surges through Hollalee’s touch, sapping the life from a single target.

#### **8. Incorporate Augments (if applicable)**

Augments enhance existing abilities when players use growth points to enhance them:

- **Range Extension:** Modify an ability’s range (e.g., Close → Short).
- **Enhanced Effects:** Protect allies, increase damage, or area size.
- **New Conditions:** Add complementary effects (e.g., *Distracted* + *Frightened*).

#### **9. Validate and Playtest**

Ensure balance by evaluating:

- **Effort Cost vs. Impact:** Free Effort abilities should be simple, while Burned Effort abilities should have significant effects.
- **Consistency:** Verify ToHit, Save, and Damage align with rules.
- **Test in Context:** Playtest abilities in game to confirm balance and synergy. Players and GMs should be ready to adjust abilities when there is an imbalance or unintended exploit.
