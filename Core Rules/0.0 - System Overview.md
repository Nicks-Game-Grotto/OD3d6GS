## **System Overview**

### **Three Domains of Power**

Characters are built upon the three fundamental Domains: **Mind**, **Body**, and **Spirit**. These Domains represent broad aspects of a character's potential and form the foundation for further customization.

- Players choose two **Attributes** for each Domain, which shape their character’s strengths and weaknesses.

### **Skills and Mastery**

Skills, tied to Attributes, represent training or innate talents in specific areas. Players assign **Mastery Levels** to Skills, which unlock **Skill Bonuses** and allow for progression.

### **Customizable Abilities**

Abilities are crafted by players and tied to specific Skills. The number and power of a character's Abilities depend on the Skill’s Mastery Level, offering a personalized toolkit for every character.

### **Effort System**

The **Effort system** adds a dynamic resource management layer to gameplay, enabling players to perform extraordinary feats and sustain powerful Abilities:

1. **Domain Effort**  

   - Characters have three primary Effort pools based on their Domains:  
     - **Stamina**: Equal to the **Body** Domain Bonus.  
     - **Focus**: Equal to the **Mind** Domain Bonus.  
     - **Resolve**: Equal to the **Spirit** Domain Bonus.

2. **Combat and Out-of-Combat Effort**  

   - Characters gain temporary Effort in the form of **Adrenaline** (in combat) and **Inspiration** (out of combat). These resources are readily available for short bursts of activity or creativity but are not as reliable as Domain Effort.

3. **Using Effort**  

   - Effort is used to **Maintain Abilities** or can be **Burned** to perform spectacular feats.  
   - Players may spend any type of Effort to activate Abilities, but **Domain Effort** is more difficult to replenish, encouraging strategic use.  
   - **Adrenaline** resets at the end of each combat round, while **Inspiration** offers creative utility between battles or in combat.

This mechanic ensures a balance between power and resource conservation, challenging players to think critically about when and how to spend their Effort. If you are swinging a sword, casting magical spells, or trying to persuade a guard to allow you to pass, you are expending effort.

#### **Character Archetypes**

Players create a **Character Archetype** to define their role and unique identity. By choosing an **Archetype Attribute** and **Archetype Skill**, players generate a **Character Archetype Bonus**. This bonus enhances actions tied to the Archetype and is the determinate score for **Archetype Save** and **Base Defense** scores.

#### **Flexible Problem Solving**

When characters act outside their Archetype, they can still rely on other Skills, Attributes, or the broader Domain Bonus Score to influence their success. This ensures every situation has a potential solution, though difficulty and risk may vary. In the ODGS, GMs will often be calling for a Mind, Body, or Spirit save. Characters will use more specific attributes and skills when the player has an idea that matches the challenge.
