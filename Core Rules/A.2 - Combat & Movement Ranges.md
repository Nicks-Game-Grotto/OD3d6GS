## Radial Movement Range for Tactical Combat

- **Radius**: The distance from the center of the circle to its edge. Think of it as how far the middle of the circle is from the outside. **Standard Movement** lets a character move anywhere within the radius (inside the circle) from where they started their action. The center resets whenever a player spends an action.

- **Area**: The total space inside the circle, contained by the edge. This is another way to describe where Standard Movement occurs.

- **Circumference**: The distance all the way around the edge of the circle, like walking along its boundary.

- **Edge**: The boundary of the circle. A target can be described as being **In** (inside the edge), **On** (touching the edge), or **Outside** (beyond the edge). This applies to both movement and targeting.

- **Diameter**: The longest distance across the circle, passing through the center. It’s twice the length of the radius. Use the diameter for ranged attacks or speed actions.

### Standard Movement

**Standard Movement** represents a character's ability to move freely within a set **Area** during their turn. It is calculated by the **Radius** extending from the character’s starting position at the beginning of their action. Players can move freely anywhere **In** that radius without extra cost or penalty. The center of the circle resets whenever a player spends an action, allowing movement to happen fluidly throughout combat or exploration.

### Extended Movement

**Extended Movement** allows players to move farther by pushing themselves beyond their standard range. To perform this, players **Spend Effort** and make a **Voluntary Body Save** at the start of an action. If successful, players can move the range scale to their character at any starting position either **In** or **On** the **Edge** of their original range scale, effectively doubling the distance they can cover in. This move extends their reach and flexibility in combat or exploration, at the cost of stamina and requiring a save.

By using **Extended Movement**, players are able to cover more ground in a single action, but the effort and risk of failure add strategic depth to deciding when and how to use this ability.

### Standard Melee Range

**Standard Melee Range** is the **Radius** centered on the character as they move in combat. This represents the estimated distance from the character’s center to the effective edge of the weapon they are using. Each weapon has a specific melee range based on its size, which is referenced on the [Weapon Scale by Size](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1hGEiCA_TN6MtI9Xti5JnmFdhinGtu6uj7rRyrnvcSak/edit) table. This allows players to visualize how far their character can strike while engaging in melee combat, with different weapons having different ranges.

Targets **In the Edge** of this range scale are susceptible to attack.  
Players must **Spend Effort** to attack targets **On the Edge** of this range scale.

### Standard Magic and Projectile Range

**Standard Ranged Range** refers to the distance across the diameter of the range scale. This applies to both magic and ranged weapons, allowing players to measure how far a spell or projectile can reach. The diameter determines the maximum distance that ranged attacks can cover during combat or other scenarios.

Players place their character **On the Edge** of the range scale and can effectively attack targets **In its Area**.
