# Combat Actions

In this system, characters use Action Points rather than following a turn-based initiative order. Each player has a number of Action Points equal to their Primary Domain Bonus, which they spend freely for actions and reactions in real-time. Combat rounds flow naturally, allowing characters to respond fluidly to each other’s actions, making battles feel dynamic and immersive.  
When all players and adversaries have spent their Action Points, the combat round ends, and each character’s Action Points reset for the next round.

## Starting and Ending Combat

### Draw Round

Combat begins with a Draw Round, allowing characters to prepare for combat but not engage in attacks or movement unless they have certain abilities. In this round:

- Characters may **Equip Weapons** or items that are stowed.
- Characters may **Begin Maintaining Effort** on certain abilities to prepare for the coming battle.  
- Attacking in the Draw Round requires the **Quick Draw Skill** or an **Unarmed Martial Arts Ability** associated with the character’s AB.  
- Moving in the Draw Round requires a **Speed Skill** or access to **Chronomancy**.

### Ambush

An ambush occurs when a character or group of characters are full prepared for combat and their adversaries are not. They have weapons drawn and are hidden or have revealed themselves in striking distance of their adversaries. Ambushers may attack without warning if they are hidden or surround their adversaries without attacking.

- Ambushers spend action and make movement and attacks while their adversaries are in a Draw Round.
- Characters are Vulnerable to Ambushers on the Draw Round.
- Hidden Ambushers have Double Advantage on the Draw Round.
- If Ambushers interact socially before attacking the adversaries may attempt to declare themselves **Bested**.

### Ending Combat

Combat ends when characters feel secure enough to stop maintaining effort and stow their weapons. Or, if players take time to make rolls out of combat to do more than a cursory investigation.

- **Bested**: When a player or GM declares a character Bested (typically at or below 2hp), the GM decides the next steps, which may include taking prisoners, losing items, or worse.  
- **Total Party Knockout (TPK)**: A **TPK** results in all characters falling unconscious. Death occurs as a progression of the **Unconscious** condition.
- **Safety**: Characters consider themselves safe enough to stow their weapons and resume normal activity.

Combat may not end immediately after hostilities cease; for example:

- In a **hostile setting**, like a dungeon, characters may choose to stay on high alert and keep weapons ready, continuing combat status without needing a Draw Round for each encounter.
- Players who want to make a Save for *social* or *exploration* usually end combat prior to the roll. Combat ends unless an Ability allows them to stay ready.

## Health, Damage, and Death Mechanics

### Vitalix (HP)

All player characters have 6 Vitalix, representing their overall health and resilience. Players reduce a character's Vitalix based on the amount of damage taken. Characters who take damage do not always lose Vitalix.

#### Damage Thresholds

Damage in this system is categorized by thresholds, each of which inflicts a set amount of Vitalix loss:

- **Minor Damage**: Reduces Vitalix by 1 for damage ≥1.  
- **Moderate Damage**: Reduces Vitalix by 2 for damage ≥7.  
- **Severe Damage**: Reduces Vitalix by 3 for damage ≥13.  
- **Deadly Damage**: Reduces Vitalix by 4. This is a special case and typically occurs through powerful attacks, critical hits, or specific conditions.

#### Damage and Conditions

When a character’s Vitalix is reduced to certain levels, they may trigger specific conditions:

1. **Bested Condition**:  
   - Trigger: A character's Vitalix is reduced to **2 or less**.
   - The character is mentally or physically defeated in some way. This affects their morale, lowers their ability to fight effectively, or forces them to retreat or submit. Characters can declare the Bested condition on themselves or try to convince adversaries to stand down if they have been bested.
2. **Incapacitated Condition**:  
   - Trigger: A character takes **Severe Damage** and is reduced to **1 Vitalix**.  
   - The character cannot make attack actions or effectively defend themselves. They may remain conscious but are otherwise unable to influence the battle or situation directly. Movement is reduced to Close or Very Close Range based on the circumstance. Incapacitated creatures are considered Bested, unless the trigger effect states that the condition is temporary. An Incapacitated creature needs to be healed to end the condition, unless the trigger effect states that the condition is temporary.
3. **Unconscious Condition**:  
   - Trigger: A character’s Vitalix is reduced to **0**.  
   - The character is knocked out, unable to act or react. Attacks against them have advantage, and any melee attacks are treated as Deadly.

#### Death Mechanics

When a character is reduced to **0 Vitalix** and becomes **Unconscious**, they must attempt to survive through Mind, Body, and Spirit Saves.

1. **Making Death Saves**:  
   - The player rolls **one Save for each Domain**: Mind, Body, and Spirit.  
   - The **Save Score** for each roll is **11**.  
   - The player can spend Effort from the Domain they are rolling for and any remaining adrenaline to increase the save rolls.
   - Other players in Very Close range can spend one inspiration per roll to prevent another player from dying.
   - A player must succeed on at least **two out of three saves** to stabilize.
2. **Stabilizing a Character**:  
   - If a character succeeds on **two or more saves**, they stabilize at **1 Vitalix** and remain Unconscious. Healing or Rest is required to return them to consciousness.  
   - The GM may determine additional narrative consequences for being reduced to 0 Vitalix more than once in a combat encounter.
3. **Character Death**:  
   - If a character fails **two or more saves**, they are considered **dead**.  
   - Death is final unless narrative or magical circumstances allow for resurrection or intervention. In other words, characters are "Only Mostly Dead."

#### Additional Rules for Damage and Death

- **Healing**: Players can roll to end a negative condition when they restore at least one Vitalix. Healing abilities use healing dice and restore health based on the Damage Threshold of the character being healed. Refer to the Damage Dice Scale using the healing row.  
- **Deadly Attacks**: Attacks against Unconscious characters automatically have advantage. Melee attacks are treated as **Deadly Damage**, reducing Vitalix by 4. If the character is already at 0 Vitalix, you might say they are "All Dead".
