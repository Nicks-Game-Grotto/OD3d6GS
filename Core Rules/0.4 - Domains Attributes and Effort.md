# Domains, Attributes, and Effort

## Domains

The game features three Attribute Domains: **Body**, **Mind**, and **Spirit**, each representing different aspects of a character’s abilities.

- **Body**: Physical prowess (e.g., Strength, Agility).  
- **Mind**: Mental acuity (e.g., Intelligence, Perception).  
- **Spirit**: Emotional resilience (e.g., Willpower, Charisma).

Characters have Domain Bonuses for **Body**, **Mind**, and **Spirit**. This bonus equals half the sum of the two chosen attributes in that Domain, rounded up. This Domain bonus is used for checks and saves that fall under the Domain but aren’t specific to a single attribute and don't combine with skills.

This number is also your character's base Effort Points for each Domain and the Action Points come from the Domain associated with the Character Archetype. See Effort and Archetype below for more information.

### The Role of Each Domain

- **Body**: Reflects the physical potential and limits of the character, influencing how they interact with and impact the physical world. Body is often the Domain of Vitalix. Players use **Stamina Effort** to perform abilities associated with Body Domain attributes.  
- **Mind**: Represents cognitive abilities, shaping how the character processes information and intellectual challenges. Mind is often the Domain of Vhidix. Players use **Focus Effort** to perform abilities associated with Mind Domain attributes.  
- **Spirit**: Acts as a bridge between Body and Mind, guiding social dynamics, emotional depth, and the energetic natural forces. Spirit is often the Domain of Manix. Players use **Resolve Effort** to perform abilities associated with Spirit Domain attributes.

## Effort

Effort Points are spent to activate abilities, such as spells, combat maneuvers, or device activations. Effort is categorized into **Stamina**, **Focus**, and **Resolve**, corresponding to Body, Mind, and Spirit attributes.

- **Starting Effort**: Characters begin each session with Effort Points equal to their Domain Bonus.  
- **Session Management**: The GM may choose not to reset Effort Points between sessions for various reasons, such as ongoing combat or survival scenarios.

### Types of Effort

- **Stamina**: Represents physical exertion. Used for physical abilities, combat maneuvers, and tasks requiring bodily strength or endurance.  
- **Focus**: Represents mental concentration. Used for tasks requiring precision, problem-solving, or magical abilities that demand intense focus.  
- **Resolve**: Represents emotional or energetic strength. Used for resisting mental attacks, maintaining ongoing effects, and handling high-stress situations.  
- **Adrenaline**: Temporary effort gained during combat. Used as Stamina, Focus, or Resolve but cannot be used as Inspiration Effort. Adrenaline Points expire at the end of combat.  
- **Inspiration**: Temporary effort gained outside of combat. Used as Stamina, Focus, or Resolve, and can be spent in combat. Inspiration Points expire at the end of the session.

### Using Effort

Effort represents a character’s ability to exert physical, mental, or spiritual energy. There are three ways to use effort: **Maintaining**, **Spending**, and **Burning** Effort.  
Spent and Burnt Effort result in immediate effects, whereas Maintained Effort allows a player to sustain ongoing abilities. Players can spend effort on one ability while maintaining effort on another, unless a specific ability states otherwise.  
Players can spend only one effort as part of their action. If players want to spend effort as part of an adversary's turn, they must first spend an action as a reaction.

#### Maintain Effort

- **Domain Dependent**: Effort must be Maintained using the effort from the Domain the task is associated with. Players cannot use Adrenaline or Inspiration to Maintain Effort.  
- **Sustaining Tasks**: Some abilities, such as spells or grappling, require ongoing effort to keep active. Players must maintain moderate effort over time to keep these abilities functioning.  
- **Rolling to Maintain**: When a character takes Moderate or greater Damage, the GM may ask the player to roll under their Save DC to continue maintaining effort. Failure may result in losing control over the effort.  
- **Redirecting Effort**: If a player wishes to switch Maintained Effort from one ability to another, they must roll under their Save DC to transfer the effort. Failure results in Burning Effort, requiring the player to spend an action to recover.

#### Spend Effort

- **Trigger Abilities**: Special abilities or spells usually require effort to activate. Players spend an action and an effort to perform an ability unless the player is maintaining effort to save actions.

#### Burn Effort

- **Burning for Extraordinary Abilities**: Players may choose to burn their effort when maintaining an ability in order to achieve an extraordinary feat. This represents pushing their ability beyond its normal limits.

**When Effort is Involuntarily Burnt**:

- Player rolls triple ones while maintaining effort.  
- Player fails a roll to switch Maintained Effort to another ability.  
- Player fails a roll to Maintain Effort after taking Moderate or greater Damage.

**Burn or End Effort with No Effect**:

- When effort is burnt involuntarily, it has no effect; the player loses control over their ability and effort is spent. The player must spend an Action and Maintain Effort to regain control of any associated Ability.  
- When a player chooses to stop maintaining effort with no effect, they return the effort to their pool.
