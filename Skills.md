# Forces and Forms

Magic in this system is divided into three fundamental forces: **Vitalix** (Life Body), **Vidhix** (Void Mind), and **Manix** (Energy Spirit). Each force manifests through five unique forms, collectively described by the suffix “mancy,” representing the magical manipulation of various elements or energies. These forms encompass a wide range of abilities, from the control of living and physical matter to the harnessing of void or spiritual energy, offering diverse paths for spellcasters to explore and master.

In this system, the three magic forces—Vitalix, Vidhix, and Manix—serve as foundational elements that shape the way magic users channel their abilities. These forces cannot be directly listed as skills on a character sheet, but their influence is fundamental to how magic manifests. Each force breaks down into five Forms, which are treated as skill categories in character creation.

Characters may select a Form as an **Archetype**, **Supplemental**, or **Heritage** Skill (limit one Heritage Skill if a Form is chosen), investing in it to gain specialized or more potent abilities tied to that Form. Any character, regardless of their chosen Form, can still cast spells from all three forces but may lack the innate mastery of those who specialize in a particular path.

## Choosing and Using Forms

Forms are an optional but potent choice for shaping a character’s magical identity. Players can integrate Forms into their character’s Archetype, Supplemental, or Heritage skills, using them to craft unique abilities and unlock powerful synergies. However, selecting a Form does not restrict access to other magical forces; instead, it deepens the character’s connection to a specific element, offering specialized benefits and greater control.

By aligning with a Form, players can:
- Develop a distinct magical style.
- Enhance efficiency and mastery over specific spells or abilities.
- Tie their character's background or heritage to the world’s mystical energies.

Through Vitalix, Vidhix, and Manix, players can explore diverse paths, tailoring their character’s magical identity to their playstyle and narrative goals.
