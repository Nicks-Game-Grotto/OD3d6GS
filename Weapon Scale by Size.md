# Weapon Scale by Size

This scale covers all weapons in the game (guns on the way), providing guidelines for size, range, weight, properties, and damage. If a player or GM is unsure about the baseline classification of a weapon, they should consult this chart to ensure balance and consistency. The damage dice scale follows this pattern: 1d3, 1d6, 3d3, 2d6+1. Adjust damage within these ranges based on the weapon's characteristics.
