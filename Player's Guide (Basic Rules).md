### **Core Mechanics**

#### **Three Domains of Power**

Characters are built upon the three fundamental Domains: **Mind**, **Body**, and **Spirit**. These Domains represent broad aspects of a character's potential and form the foundation for further customization.

- Players choose two **Attributes** for each Domain, which shape their character’s strengths and determine **Attribute Bonus Scores**.

#### **Skills and Mastery**

Skills, tied to Attributes, represent training or innate talents in specific areas. Players assign **Mastery Levels** to Skills, which unlock **Skill Bonuses** and allow for progression.

#### **Customizable Abilities**

Abilities are crafted by players and tied to specific Skills. The number and power of a character's Abilities depend on the Skill’s Mastery Level, offering a personalized toolkit for every character.

#### **Effort System**

The **Effort system** adds a dynamic resource management layer to gameplay, enabling players to perform extraordinary feats and sustain powerful Abilities:

1. **Domain Effort**  
     
   - Characters have three primary Effort pools based on their Domains:  
     - **Stamina**: Equal to the **Body** Domain Bonus.  
     - **Focus**: Equal to the **Mind** Domain Bonus.  
     - **Resolve**: Equal to the **Spirit** Domain Bonus.

   

2. **Combat and Out-of-Combat Effort**  
     
   - Characters gain temporary Effort in the form of **Adrenaline** (in combat) and **Inspiration** (out of combat). These resources are readily available for short bursts of activity or creativity but are not as reliable as Domain Effort.

   

3. **Using Effort**  
     
   - Effort is used to **Maintain Abilities** or can be **Burned** to perform spectacular feats.  
   - Players may spend any type of Effort to activate Abilities, but **Domain Effort** is more difficult to replenish, encouraging strategic use.  
   - **Adrenaline** resets at the end of each combat round, while **Inspiration** offers creative utility between battles.

This mechanic ensures a balance between power and resource conservation, challenging players to think critically about when and how to spend their Effort.

#### **Character Archetypes**

Players create a **Character Archetype** to define their role and unique identity. By choosing an **Archetype Domain**, specific **Attributes**, and **Skills**, players generate a **Character Archetype Bonus**. This bonus enhances actions tied to the Archetype, fostering thematic and impactful gameplay.

#### **Flexible Problem Solving**

When characters act outside their Archetype, they can still rely on other Skills, Attributes, or the broader Domain Bonus Score to influence their success. This ensures every situation has a potential solution, though difficulty and risk may vary.

The cascading archetype system and innovative Effort mechanics encourage players to push the boundaries of creativity and forge unforgettable stories in any genre or setting.

# Dice System

## Rolling 3d6 for Challenges

Success is determined by meeting the required number, whether rolling for a Save or Voluntary Save. If the roll matches the target number—whether rolling above for a Save or below for a Voluntary Save—the challenge is successfully overcome.

* **Saves**: Succeed when the sum of the dice rolled, plus relevant skill and attribute modifiers, meets or exceeds the challenge’s Save Score.  
* **Voluntary Saves**: Succeed when the sum of the dice rolled meets or falls below the character’s Save Score.

### Saves (Forced Challenges)

Saves occur when external forces push a character into a situation beyond their control. These reactive challenges are resolved by rolling 3d6, adding relevant skill and attribute modifiers, and aiming to exceed a Save Score set by the GM.

#### Example:

A character falls off a cliff and must pull themselves up. They roll 3d6, add their **Strength** and **Heavy Lifting** modifiers, and attempt to exceed a Save Score of 15\.

* **Roll Calculation**: 3d6 \+ Strength \+ Heavy Lifting \= Total  
* If the total is **15 or greater**, the character succeeds.

#### Summary:

* Saves are active or reactive responses to external challenges.  
* Players must roll **above** a Save Score set by the GM.  
* These rolls represent circumstances where the character has limited control over the outcome.

### Voluntary Saves (Player-Driven Actions)

Voluntary Saves are proactive, occurring when characters attempt tasks within their expertise or control. These challenges are resolved by rolling 3d6 and aiming to roll **below** the character’s personal Save Score, which reflects their mastery of the task.

#### Example:

An alchemist brews a familiar potion. They roll 3d6 and attempt to roll under their Save Score of 14 (calculated as 8 \+ Alchemy 3 \+ Intuition 3).

* **Roll Calculation**: 3d6 \= Total  
* If the total is **14 or less**, the character succeeds.

For unfamiliar or challenging tasks (e.g., brewing a complex potion), this would be treated as a regular Save, requiring the player to roll above a specific Save Score determined by the GM.

#### Summary:

* Voluntary Saves represent proactive challenges where characters are in control.  
* Players must roll **at or below** their own Save Score.  
* These rolls apply to tasks the character has experience or mastery over.

### Player Agency and Character Expertise

The system emphasizes player choice and character expertise:

* **Saves** are for reactive situations where the character faces external challenges.  
* **Voluntary Saves** empower players by relying on their character’s mastery and skill.

#### Example Comparison:

* A **Brute** falls off a cliff and must roll above a **Save Score** of 15 because climbing is not part of their expertise.  
* An **Athlete** with climbing skills can treat this same challenge as a Voluntary Save, rolling under their own Save Score instead.

### Dice Mechanics

* Roll **3d6** and add relevant skill and attribute modifiers. Often, this is your Archetype Bonus (AB).  
  * **Example**: A Brute with **Heavy Lifting 3** and **Strength 2** rolls 3d6 \+ 5 against a Save Score of 15\.  
* If no relevant skill applies, add only the Attribute Modifier:  
  * **Example**: A Fighter with **Strength 3** rolls 3d6 \+ 3 against a Save Score of 15\.  
* If no relevant attribute applies, add only the Domain Modifier:  
  * **Example**: A Mage with **Body \-1** rolls 3d6 \- 1 against a Save Score of 15\.  
* Compare the total to the Save Score, typically ranging from 12 to 25\.

### Rolling with Advantage or Disadvantage: A Dice Pool System

The system uses a **dice pool** mechanic to handle advantage and disadvantage, allowing players to roll additional dice and choose the best or worst outcomes. For **Advantage** or **Disadvantage**, players adjust their dice pool by rolling **extra dice** and then choosing the **best** or **worst** three dice based on their situation. The system ensures fairness while maintaining the balance of stacking advantages or penalties.

#### Rolling with Advantage

Advantage allows players to add up to **three additional dice** to their roll (up to a maximum of **6d6** total) and choose the **best results**. This represents favorable circumstances or bonuses.

1. **Single Advantage**: Roll **1 extra die** (4d6 total); keep the highest **3 dice**.  
2. **Double Advantage**: Roll **2 extra dice** (5d6 total); keep the highest **3 dice**.  
3. **Triple Advantage**: Roll **3 extra dice** (6d6 total); keep the highest **3 dice**.

**Key Rules**:

* Advantage can stack from multiple sources but is capped at **Triple Advantage (6d6 total)**.  
* Players choose which 3 dice they take for the roll..

### Rolling with Disadvantage

Disadvantage forces players to roll **additional dice** and choose the **worst three results**. This represents unfavorable circumstances or penalties. For **Double** or **Triple Disadvantage**, rolling Doubles or Triples do not count as hits and do not replenish effort.

1. **Single Disadvantage**: Roll **1 extra die** (4d6 total); keep the lowest **3 dice**.  
2. **Double Disadvantage**: Roll **2 extra dice** (5d6 total); keep the lowest **3 dice**.  
3. **Triple Disadvantage**: Roll **3 extra dice** (6d6 total); keep the lowest **3 dice**.

#### Key Rules:

* Disadvantage can stack from multiple sources but is capped at **Triple Disadvantage (6d6 total)**.  
* Always choose the **lowest three dice** from the total rolled.  
* Avoid taking doubles or triples, except for triple ones.

### Rolling Doubles, Triples, and Criticals

#### Rolling Doubles

* **In Combat**: Gain temporary **Adrenaline Effort** equal to the value of the third die.  
  * **Adrenaline Effort** can be **Spent** as **Stamina**, **Focus**, or **Resolve** and expires at the end of combat.  
  * Players may choose to count a rolled double as a **hit** instead of recharging their Effort pools.  
* **Outside Combat**: Gain temporary **Inspiration Effort** equal to the value of the third die.  
  * **Inspiration Effort** can be **Spent** as **Stamina**, **Focus**, or **Resolve** and expires at the end of the session.

#### Rolling Triples (2-5)

Players succeed on their save automatically.

* **In Combat**: Gain **Adrenaline Effort** equal to the value of one die.  
  * The attack hits.  
  * **Adrenaline Effort** can be **Spent** as **Stamina**, **Focus**, or **Resolve** and expire at the end of combat.  
  * Add half the value of the total roll (rounded up) to the damage roll.  
* **Outside Combat**: Gain temporary **Inspiration Effort** equal to **double the value** of one die.  
  * **Inspiration Effort** can be **Spent** as **Stamina**, **Focus**, or **Resolve** and expires at the end of the session.

#### Rolling Triple Six

* **In Combat**: Trigger a **Critical Hit**, adding **\+18** to the damage roll.  
* **Outside Combat**: All party members gain **2 Effort Points** that expire at the end of the session.  
  * Players may expend all their points for an automatic success on the roll.

#### Rolling Triple One

* **Fail to Maintain Effort**: Burn Maintained Effort Point with no effect.  
* **In Combat**:  
  * **Fumble**: The GM may react with a counterattack that does not cost action points.  
  * The player becomes **Vulnerable** until the start of their next action.  
* **Outside Combat**:  
  * Automatically fail the check, rendering the task impossible for the party using similar means.  
  * **Note for GMs**: When a door closes, open a window. Even failed rolls should lead to new challenges or opportunities.

# Combat Actions

In this system, characters use Action Points rather than following a turn-based initiative order. Each player has a number of Action Points equal to their Primary Domain Bonus, which they spend freely for actions and reactions in real-time. Combat rounds flow naturally, allowing characters to respond fluidly to each other’s actions, making battles feel dynamic and immersive.  
When all players and adversaries have spent their Action Points, the combat round ends, and each character’s Action Points reset for the next round.

## Optional Turn-Based Guidance

For new players or GMs who prefer a structured approach, a clockwise turn order around the table is suggested. The GM may intersperse actions between or after players’ actions.  
*Note*: This optional setup is experimental and may require additional balancing to maintain fair mechanics.

## Starting and Ending Combat

### Draw Round

Combat begins with a Draw Round, allowing characters to prepare for combat but not engage in attacks or movement unless they have certain abilities. In this round:

- Characters may **Equip Weapons** or items that are stowed.  
- Characters may **Begin Maintaining Effort** on certain abilities to prepare for the coming battle.  
- Attacking in the Draw Round requires the **Quick Draw Skill** or an **Unarmed Martial Arts Ability** associated with the character’s AB.  
- Moving in the Draw Round requires the **Speed Skill** or access to **Chronomancy Magic**.

### Ending Combat

Combat ends when characters feel secure enough to stop maintaining effort and stow their weapons. Or, if players take time to make rolls out of combat to do more than a cursory investigation.

- **Bested**: When a player or GM declares a character Bested (typically at or below 2hp), the GM decides the next steps, which may include taking prisoners, losing items, or worse.  
- **Total Party Knockout (TPK)**: A TPK results in all characters falling unconscious. Death occurs as a progression of the Unconscious Condition, explained later.

Combat may not end immediately after hostilities cease; for example:

- In a **safe area**, such as after a bandit attack, characters can quickly stow weapons and resume normal activity.  
- In a **hostile setting**, like a dungeon, characters may choose to stay on high alert and keep weapons ready, continuing combat status without needing a Draw Round for each encounter.

Players and GMs should agree on when combat status officially ends.

## Health, Damage, and Death Mechanics

### Vitalix (HP)

All player characters begin the game with 6 Vitalix, representing their overall health and resilience. Damage reduces Vitalix based on the severity of the attack.

#### Damage Thresholds

Damage in this system is categorized by thresholds, each of which inflicts a set amount of Vitalix loss:

- **Minor Damage**: Reduces Vitalix by 1 for damage ≥1.  
- **Moderate Damage**: Reduces Vitalix by 2 for damage ≥7.  
- **Severe Damage**: Reduces Vitalix by 3 for damage ≥13.  
- **Deadly Damage**: Reduces Vitalix by 4\. This is a special case and typically occurs through powerful attacks, critical hits, or specific conditions.

#### Damage and Conditions

When a character’s Vitalix is reduced to certain levels, they may trigger specific conditions:

1. **Bested Condition**:  
   - Trigger: A character's Vitalix is reduced to **2 or below**.  
   - Refer to the "Bested" condition for additional details.  
2. **Incapacitated Condition**:  
   - Trigger: A character takes **Severe Damage** and is reduced to **1 Vitalix**.  
   - Refer to the "Incapacitated" condition for effects and restrictions.  
3. **Unconscious Condition**:  
   - Trigger: A character’s Vitalix is reduced to **0**.  
   - Refer to the "Unconscious" condition for additional rules.

#### Death Mechanics

When a character is reduced to **0 Vitalix** and becomes **Unconscious**, they must attempt to survive through Mind, Body, and Spirit Saves.

1. **Making Death Saves**:  
   - The player rolls **one Save for each Domain**: Mind, Body, and Spirit.  
   - The **Save Score** for each roll is **12**.  
   - The player can spend Effort from the domain or remaining adrenaline to increase the save roll. They can spend as much effort as they like.  
   - A player must succeed on at least **two out of three saves** to stabilize.  
2. **Stabilizing a Character**:  
   - If a character succeeds on **two or more saves**, they stabilize at **1 Vitalix** and remain Unconscious. Healing or Rest is required to return them to consciousness.  
   - The GM may determine additional narrative consequences for being reduced to 0 Vitalix.  
3. **Character Death**:  
   - If a character fails **two or more saves**, they are considered **dead**.  
   - Death is final unless narrative or magical circumstances allow for resurrection or intervention. In other words, characters are only mostly dead.

#### Additional Rules for Damage and Death

- **Healing**: Characters can be healed from any condition by regaining Vitalix, provided their total Vitalix does not exceed their starting maximum of 6\. Refer to the rules for specific healing mechanics.  
- **Deadly Attacks**: Attacks against Unconscious characters automatically have advantage. Melee attacks are treated as **Deadly Damage**, reducing Vitalix by 4\. If the character is already at 0 Vitalix, this confirms their death.

# Domains, Attributes, and Effort

## Domains

The game features three Attribute Domains: **Body**, **Mind**, and **Spirit**, each representing different aspects of a character’s abilities.

- **Body**: Physical prowess (e.g., Strength, Agility).  
- **Mind**: Mental acuity (e.g., Intelligence, Perception).  
- **Spirit**: Emotional resilience (e.g., Willpower, Charisma).

Characters have Domain Bonuses for **Body**, **Mind**, and **Spirit**. This bonus equals half the sum of the two chosen attributes in that Domain, rounded up. This Domain bonus is used for checks and saves that fall under the Domain but aren’t specific to a single attribute and don't combine with skills.

This number is also your character's base Effort Points for each Domain and the Action Points come from the Domain associated with the Character Archetype. See Effort and Archetype below for more information.

### The Role of Each Domain

- **Body**: Reflects the physical potential and limits of the character, influencing how they interact with and impact the physical world. Body is often the Domain of Vitalimancy. Players use **Stamina Effort** to perform abilities associated with Body Domain attributes.  
- **Mind**: Represents cognitive abilities, shaping how the character processes information and intellectual challenges. Mind is often the Domain of Vhidimancy. Players use **Focus Effort** to perform abilities associated with Mind Domain attributes.  
- **Spirit**: Acts as a bridge between Body and Mind, guiding social dynamics, emotional depth, and the energetic natural forces. Spirit is often the Domain of Manimancy. Players use **Resolve Effort** to perform abilities associated with Spirit Domain attributes.

## Attributes

Players choose character attributes. New players should choose from the list below.

### Body

**Description**: Represents physical aspects, such as strength, agility, and endurance, impacting combat, health, and physical challenges.

- **Strength (STR)**: Physical power.  
- **Agility (AGI)**: Speed and nimbleness. Bodily coordination.  
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Precision, especially where hand-eye coordination is concerned.  
- **Beauty (BEA)**: Influence over the perceiver or likeability based on physical appearance.  
- **Constitution (CON)**: Endurance and health.

### Mind

**Description**: Encompasses cognitive abilities like reasoning, awareness, and mental clarity, influencing problem-solving and decision-making.

- **Intelligence (MEN)**: Reasoning/Memory.  
- **Mindfulness (MIN)**: Personal Awareness/Mental Clarity.  
- **Perception (PER)**: External Sensory Acuity/Interpretation.  
- **Intuition (INT)**: Gut Feelings/Quick Judgments.  
- **Discipline (DIS)**: Impulse Control/Conditioning.

### Spirit

**Description**: Covers the connection between Mind and Body, including emotional intelligence, willpower, and charisma, affecting social interactions and personal resolve.

- **Charisma (CHA)**: Influence and likeability based on personality.  
- **Willpower (WIL)**: Inner strength.  
- **Luck (LCK)**: Gambling, Fated Rolls.  
- **Empathy (EMP)**: Emotional intelligence.  
- **Grace (GRA)**: Composure and elegance.

## Effort

Effort Points are spent to activate abilities, such as spells, combat maneuvers, or device activations. Effort is categorized into **Stamina**, **Focus**, and **Resolve**, corresponding to Body, Mind, and Spirit attributes.

- **Starting Effort**: Characters begin each session with Effort Points equal to their Domain Bonus.  
- **Session Management**: The GM may choose not to reset Effort Points between sessions for various reasons, such as ongoing combat or survival scenarios.

### Types of Effort

- **Stamina**: Represents physical exertion. Used for physical abilities, combat maneuvers, and tasks requiring bodily strength or endurance.  
- **Focus**: Represents mental concentration. Used for tasks requiring precision, problem-solving, or magical abilities that demand intense focus.  
- **Resolve**: Represents emotional or energetic strength. Used for resisting mental attacks, maintaining ongoing effects, and handling high-stress situations.  
- **Adrenaline**: Temporary effort gained during combat. Used as Stamina, Focus, or Resolve but cannot be used as Inspiration Effort. Adrenaline Points expire at the end of combat.  
- **Inspiration**: Temporary effort gained outside of combat. Used as Stamina, Focus, or Resolve, and can be spent in combat. Inspiration Points expire at the end of the session.

### Using Effort

Effort represents a character’s ability to exert physical, mental, or spiritual energy. There are three ways to use effort: **Maintaining**, **Spending**, and **Burning** Effort.  
Spent and Burnt Effort result in immediate effects, whereas Maintained Effort allows a player to sustain ongoing abilities. Players can spend effort on one ability while maintaining effort on another, unless a specific ability states otherwise.  
Players can spend only one effort as part of their or a teammate’s action. If players want to spend effort as part of an adversary's turn, they must first spend an action as a reaction.

#### Maintain Effort

- **Domain Dependent**: Effort must be Maintained using the effort from the Domain the task is associated with. Players cannot use Adrenaline or Inspiration to Maintain Effort.  
- **Sustaining Tasks**: Some abilities, such as spells or grappling, require ongoing effort to keep active. Players must maintain moderate effort over time to keep these abilities functioning.  
- **Rolling to Maintain**: When a character takes Moderate or greater Damage, the GM may ask the player to roll under their Save DC to continue maintaining effort. Failure may result in losing control over the effort.  
- **Redirecting Effort**: If a player wishes to switch Maintained Effort from one ability to another, they must roll under their Save DC to transfer the effort. Failure results in Burning Effort, requiring the player to spend an action to recover.

#### Spend Effort

- **Increase Rolls**: Players can spend 1 Effort Point to increase a roll by \+1 in the relevant Attribute Category.  
- **Trigger Abilities**: Special abilities or spells may require effort to activate. Players spend the required number of points to perform these exceptional actions.  
- **Helping Others**: Players can spend effort to assist another player by declaring their support after the roll but before the GM announces the result.  
  - Multiple players can assist by spending 1 point each.  
  - If a party member rolls triple sixes out of combat, players may pool multiple Effort Points to assist them.

#### Burn Effort

- **Burning for Extraordinary Abilities**: Players may choose to burn their effort when maintaining an ability in order to achieve an extraordinary feat. This represents pushing their ability beyond its normal limits.

**When Effort is Involuntarily Burnt**:

- Rolls triple ones while maintaining effort.  
- Fails a roll to switch Maintained Effort to another ability.  
- Fails a roll to Maintain Effort after taking Moderate or greater Damage.

**Burn or End Effort with No Effect**:

- When effort is burnt involuntarily, it has no effect; the player loses control over their ability and effort is spent. The player must spend an Action and Maintain Effort to regain control of any associated Ability.  
- When a player chooses to stop maintaining effort with no effect, they return the effort to their pool.

# Skills and Abilities

## Skills and Skill Categories

### Skill Categories vs. Skills

In this game system, there is an important distinction between **Skill Categories** and **Skills**. While Skill Categories unlock a range of actions, Skills are the specific abilities that must be tied to Abilities or character traits like Heritage or Archetype to be fully utilized.

### Skill Categories

Skill Categories are broad groups that represent a range of related skills. When a player chooses a Skill Category, they gain access to all the related skills within that category for challenges. These are written on the character sheet as part of the Character Archetype. You can use any skill from the category as if it were on your sheet during relevant challenges.

**For example:**

A character with the **Athletics** category can perform **Climbing** or **Sprinting** challenges as if those skills were on their sheet.

Choosing a Skill Category is a powerful choice because it gives you access to many related skills that can be used freely for challenges. However, these skills do not automatically carry over to combat abilities unless they are tied to specific abilities.

### Skills

Skills are the specific abilities that appear on the character sheet, tied directly to your character’s Abilities, Archetype, or Heritage. Unlike skill categories, these specific skills need to be selected or unlocked through character creation or progression.

**For example:**

If a player wants to imbue their weapon with fire during combat, they need the **Imbue Element (Fire)** skill. This is not a general category but a specific skill. The player must tie this skill to an ability, typically through Archetype, Heritage, or as a Supplemental Skill.

Unlike Skill Categories, specific skills cannot be used as freely. They require direct integration into the character’s abilities. If a skill is not tied to your Archetype, Heritage, or a Supplemental Skill, you cannot use it as part of your Archetype Abilities.

**Example:**

Imagine a player selects the **Weapon Master** Skill Category as part of their Archetype. This gives them access to a broad range of related skills, such as **Swordplay** and **Archery**. The player can use these for challenges that involve using these weapons.

However, if the same player wants to imbue their sword with fire during combat, they need to select the specific skill **Imbue Element (Fire)**. This skill must be tied to an Ability, such as a combat ability in their Archetype. If **Imbue Element (Fire)** comes from their Heritage or Supplemental Skills, they can connect it to their combat abilities, allowing them to use it in combat. If not, the skill cannot be used freely in combat.

### Summary

- **Skill Categories** give you broad access to related skills for challenges but do not automatically apply to combat.  
- **Skills** are specific actions that must be tied to abilities through Archetype, Heritage, or Supplemental Skills to be fully utilized in combat or special circumstances.

The flexibility of **Skill Categories** is powerful during challenges, while **Skills** provide focused, powerful abilities during combat.

## Abilities

### Understanding Abilities

In this game, Abilities represent the unique actions and powers your character can perform by using their Skills. Each Ability is tied to a character’s Effort, which reflects the physical, mental, or spiritual energy they expend to execute these actions. Abilities are the backbone of your character’s power, guiding how they leverage their skills in gameplay, especially in combat and challenges.

### Abilities and Effort

Every Ability is tied to one or more of your character’s Effort Points: **Stamina (Body)**, **Focus (Mind)**, or **Resolve (Spirit)**. These are limited resources your character uses to perform exceptional feats.

- **Maintaining Effort**: Some abilities require Maintained Effort, meaning the character must continuously focus or exert themselves to keep the ability active. For example, maintaining a defensive stance or holding a magical shield in place requires sustained effort.  
- **Spending Effort**: Abilities that require Spent Effort are one-time actions, like a powerful attack or casting a spell. These cost effort points in the moment but don’t need to be maintained.  
- **Burning Effort**: Certain powerful abilities require you to Burn Effort. This represents pushing beyond your limits, performing extraordinary feats like executing a devastating combo attack or using magic to alter the environment. Burning Effort is often reserved for dramatic moments, as it depletes your reserves until you recover.

### How Abilities Work

Abilities describe how your character uses the Skills tied to their Archetype, Heritage, or Supplemental Skills during gameplay. Each Ability represents a unique way your character can combine their skills with effort to achieve powerful results.

**Example:**

- A **Pyromancer** might have an ability called *Flame Strike*, where they Spend Effort to summon a blast of fire, using their *Imbue Element (Fire)* skill. The player rolls dice and adds their Pyromancy skill to determine how successful the ability is.  
- A **Martial Artist** might have an ability called *Defensive Stance*, requiring them to Maintain Effort to increase their defense and react swiftly with skills like *Parry* or *Counterstrike* during combat.  
- A **Storyteller** could have an ability like *Inspire Allies*, where they Burn Effort to give their teammates bonuses by using their *Persuasion* or *Performance* skills.

### Tying Skills to Abilities

Each Ability your character uses is tied to a Skill or combination of skills. These skills, drawn from your Skill Categories, define the range of actions your character can perform. When creating or using an ability, the skills you select dictate how you can apply your effort.

**For example:**

- A character with the **Weapon Master** category might create an ability like *Whirling Blades*, spending effort to attack multiple targets using *Dual Wielding* and *Swords*.  
- A character with the **Summoner** category might create an ability like *Summon Guardian Spirit*, maintaining effort to keep a summoned ally in the fight, using their *Summoning* and *Vitalimancy* skills.

Your character’s abilities give you direct control over how you express your skills in combat and challenges. When you create an ability, you decide which skills it uses, what kind of effort it requires, and how it functions during gameplay.

### Creating and Using Abilities

1. **Choose Your Skills**: Pick the skills that will fuel your ability from your Skill Categories or individual skills on your sheet.  
2. **Decide on Effort**: Determine whether the ability requires Maintained, Spent, or Burnt effort. This will impact how and when you can use it in combat or challenges.  
3. **Describe Your Action**: When you use the ability, narrate how your character taps into their skills to perform the action. For example, if you’re using *Imbue Element (Fire)*, describe how flames erupt from your weapon to strike an opponent.  
4. **Roll for Success**: Use the relevant skill and attribute bonuses when rolling to see how effective the ability is, whether you’re casting a spell, making an attack, or supporting an ally.

### Summary

- Abilities are actions tied to Effort, representing how your character uses their skills during gameplay.  
- Maintained, Spent, and Burnt Effort describe the different ways your character uses their energy to activate abilities.  
- Abilities are created by combining your skills with effort, allowing you to perform unique and powerful actions in combat and challenges.  
- Abilities give players a flexible and dynamic way to interact with the game world, letting you define how your character uses their skills to overcome challenges and achieve extraordinary feats.

# Character Creation

## Name & Attributes

Think about the type of character you would like to play and give them a **Name**.

From each Domain (**Body**, **Mind**, **Spirit**), choose two attributes that best represent your character’s abilities and personality. For example, you might select **Strength (STR)** and **Agility (AGI)** for Body, **Intelligence (MEN)** and **Perception (PER)** for Mind, and **Willpower (WIL)** and **Charisma (CHA)** for Spirit.

The first selection that you make will be your **Archetype Attribute**. This is the character's most developed attribute. Later, you will choose an **Archetype Skill** and derive your **Archetype Bonus (AB)** by adding the Skill and Attribute together. The AB will determine your base **Save Score** and **Defense**, as well as being the modifier on most dice rolls, making this the first crucial decision related to character creation.

### Body Attributes (choose two)

- **Strength (STR)**: Physical Power  
- **Agility (AGI)**: Speed/Nimbleness  
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Coordination/Precision  
- **Beauty (BEA)**: Appearance/Attraction  
- **Constitution (CON)**: Endurance/Health

### Mind Attributes (choose two)

- **Intelligence (MEN)**: Reasoning/Memory  
- **Mindfulness (MIN)**: Personal Awareness/Mental Clarity  
- **Perception (PER)**: External Sensory Acuity/Interpretation  
- **Intuition (INT)**: Gut Feelings/Quick Judgments  
- **Discipline (DIS)**: Impulse Control/Conditioning

### Spirit Attributes (choose two)

- **Charisma (CHA)**: Influence/Social Prowess  
- **Willpower (WIL)**: Inner Strength/Determination  
- **Luck (LCK)**: Statistics/Probability  
- **Empathy (EMP)**: Understanding/Connection  
- **Grace (GRA)**: Composure/Elegance

---

### Progress: Attributes Example

**Name**: Joe Shepard

| Body | Mind | Spirit |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| STR (-1) | PER (-1) | EMP (-1) |
| CON (-1) | DIS (-1) | WIL (-1) |

---

## Heritage

Your character's **Heritable Traits** reflect their physical form, natural talents, and cultural heritage, which will influence their abilities and outlook. Your heritable traits provide a unique starting point for your character, manifesting as a **\+1 bonus to a chosen attribute** and **two skills** based on your heritage.

Consider what heritable traits best fit your character concept. Do they possess the Grace of an Elf, the Constitution of a Dwarf, or the Perception of a Goblin? Each set of heritable traits offers different advantages. Feel free to have mixed ancestry from as many or as few people groups as you like, but remember you only increase one Attribute Point.

### Heritage Attribute

Choose one of your six Attributes and raise the bonus by one, increasing it to 0\.

### Heritage Skills

Choose two skills related to your heritage. These skills can be used as part of your Archetype when you create abilities later. You can choose from the specific skills listed in the skill categories or create one. Specific skills are one or two words (e.g., **Tracking**, **Heavy Lifting**, **Rapier**, **Dark Vision**, **Prehensile Tail**) that describe a narrowly defined skill. This might be something most people in your culture learn or an innate ability based on genetic traits.

---

## Background

Your background represents your character’s life before they became an adventurer. It shapes their skills, knowledge, and motivations, offering insight into their past experiences. The GM might require players to choose an Attribute different from the one chosen for Heritable Traits.

Think about your character’s history. Were they a soldier, a scholar, or perhaps a merchant? Your background will inform your character’s worldview and provide them with a **\+2 bonus to one attribute**.

### Background Attribute

Choose any one of your six attributes, excluding the one chosen for the Heritable Trait, to receive a \+2 bonus. This bonus should align with the strengths, knowledge, or spiritual enhancements your character has gained through their background. For instance, a background as a **Monk** might lead you to assign the \+2 bonus to Mindfulness, reflecting their inner knowledge, while a **Butcher** might assign Dexterity, and a **Smith** would assign Strength.

---

### Social and Economic Status

Decide if your character begins with a significant **connection**, such as an ally, mentor, or organization that can aid them during their adventures. Alternatively, you can opt to start with extra **money**, giving your character more resources to equip themselves or purchase valuable items. This choice reflects your character's social ties and financial status before the start of the game.

- **Connections**: These should be relevant to the game being played. The connection should have value and be helpful but not someone that the party will become dependent upon.  
- **Wealth**: Often a character's background might include a combination of Wealth and Social status. Balance these by having characters with contradictory positive and negative starting life circumstances.

---

### Progress: Background Example

**Name**: Joe Shepard

**Heritage Attribute**: Perception \+1  
**Heritage**: Joe was a goat herder. He is a **Light Sleeper** (creatures have disadvantage to sneak into Joe and his party's camp) and can **Track** creatures in mountainous terrain.

**Background Attribute**: Strength \+2  
**Background**: Joe left home to become a stone worker in the big city.  
**Connections**: Joe has a good rapport with the common folk, and Harry Farmer lets Joe crash at his place whenever he's in town.  
**Economic Status**: Joe is a saver. He maintains a comfortable lifestyle when not adventuring. He dreams of buying a space in the city to start a martial arts academy.

### Progress

| Body | Mind | Spirit |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| STR (1) | PER (0) | EMP (-1) |
| CON (-1) | DIS (-1) | WIL (-1) |

**Heritage Skill**: Tracking (0)  
**Heritage Skill**: Light Sleeper (0)

## Distribute Attribute Points

After choosing your Attributes, you'll need to assign values to them, shaping your character’s strengths and weaknesses. You have already distributed 3 points and now you will get 9 more points. Realize that this is the only time you will be able to buy higher bonuses for one point. During character growth, increasing Attribute Bonuses becomes cost-prohibitive.

### Allocate 9 Points

You have 9 points to distribute among your six chosen attributes. Each point raises an attribute’s score by \+1. Attributes start at \-1. No attribute can be raised higher than \+3 at this stage. This limitation ensures system integrity.

Decide whether to focus on a few strong attributes or spread your points evenly. For example, a character focused on physical combat might max out **Strength (STR)** and **Agility (AGI)**, while a well-rounded character might distribute points more evenly.

Consider how the Attributes will combine with Skills and Abilities to have greater opportunities and more options during gameplay.

### Considerations for Archetype and Attribute Selection

Later in the character creation process, you will choose a **Primary Archetype** associated with a single Attribute and **two Skill Categories**. This determines the character’s Archetype Bonus, Defense, and Save score. High numbers in these traits will significantly impact your character’s capabilities in challenges and combat.

### Determine Attribute Domain Bonuses

Calculate the bonus for each Attribute Domain (**Body**, **Mind**, **Spirit**). This bonus equals half the sum of the two chosen attributes in that Domain, rounded up. This Domain bonus will be used for checks and saves that fall under the Domain but aren’t specific to a single attribute and don't combine with skills. This number is also your character's base **Effort Points**.

---

### Progress: Attribute Distribution Example

**Name**: Joe Shepard

**Heritage Attribute**: Perception \+1  
**Background Attribute**: Strength \+2

**Distribution of Attribute Points**:

- Starting Points: 9  
- STR: \-2 → 9 \- 2 \= 7  
- CON: \-4 → 7 \- 4 \= 3  
- PER: \-1 → 3 \- 1 \= 2  
- DIS: \-2 → 2 \- 2 \= 0  
- Remaining Points: 0

| Body | Mind | Spirit |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 3 | 1 | \-1 |

| STR | CON | PER | DIS | EMP | WIL |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 | \-1 | \-1 |

---

## Select Skills

During Character Creation, players make foundational choices about their character's skills, which will shape their abilities throughout the game. This is the only time players can select broad **Skill Categories**, which grant access to groups of related skills rather than individual skills. Choices made during this phase represent the most valuable use of points, as these points have a greater long-term effect than the Character Growth Points earned later.

Skills are the language used to build **Abilities** and serve as the link between **Character Attributes** and **Abilities**. Players will define their Abilities when they define their Archetype.

---

### Skill Categories

- **Heritage Skills**: These are specific, individual skills. Abilities created with these skills roll with their associated Attribute and Skill Mastery Bonus. If a player wants to use these skills as part of their Archetype, it requires **Spent** or **Maintained Effort** at the Novice Skill Mastery Level.  
  *You’ve already chosen these skills during Character Creation.*  
    
- **Archetype Skill**: This represents **two general skill groups** chosen by the player. Abilities created with these groups roll with and contribute to the character’s Archetype Bonus.  
    
- **Supplemental Skill**: This is a single general skill group. Abilities created with these skills roll with their associated Attribute and Skill Mastery Bonus. Using these skills as part of the Archetype requires **Spent** or **Maintained Effort** at the Skilled Skill Mastery Level.  
    
- **Specific Skills**: These are individual, specific skills. Abilities created with these skills roll with their associated Attribute and Skill Mastery Bonus. Using these skills as part of the Archetype requires **Spent** or **Maintained Effort** at the Expert Skill Mastery Level.

---

### Archetype Skill

The **Archetype Skill** represents your character’s most broadly defined and developed skill set. You will select **two Skill Categories** to combine under a single Archetype Skill.

**Example**:  
Consider naming your Archetype Skill “Sword & Board” and choosing the **Skirmisher/Soldier** and **Shield Arts** Skill Categories. These combined skills will provide access to weapons- and armor-related actions, such as using your shield to parry or enhance defense.

These skills will be associated with your character’s Archetype Attribute, chosen during character creation. This Attribute should complement the concept of your Archetype Skill. For instance, **Strength** or **Agility** would suit most warriors, but you could work with your GM to tie **Empathy** to a unique combat style if it fits your vision.

Spending Character Creation Points to raise mastery in the Archetype Skill also raises mastery for the two associated Skill Categories, making this a highly cost-effective investment.

---

### Supplemental Skill

The **Supplemental Skill** is the third and final broad skill category you select. It complements your Archetype Skill and adds depth to your character.

**Example**:  
For a “Sword & Board” character, you might select **Athletics** as a Supplemental Skill, gaining access to abilities like **Leap**, **Shove**, and **Braced**—all useful for a front-line fighter.

Supplemental skills can contribute to your Archetype Bonus once they reach the **Skilled (3)** Mastery Level.

---

### Distribute 9 Skill Mastery Points

At this point, your sheet should show four skills: an **Archetype Skill**, a **Supplemental Skill**, and two **Heritage Skills**. You must spend two of your nine available skill mastery points to raise the Archetype and Supplemental Skills to the Apprentice Level. Refer to the Skill Mastery Table for details. The remaining seven points can be spent freely, either improving existing skills or gaining specific new skills. The highest mastery level for new characters is Skilled (3).

---

### Progress: Skill Distribution Example

**Name**: Joe Shepard

**Distribution of Skill Points**:

- Starting Points: 9  
- Sword & Board: \-3 → 9 \- 3 \= 6  
- Athletics: \-2 → 6 \- 2 \= 4  
- Slow Bleeder: \-3 → 4 \- 3 \= 1  
- Tracking: \-1 → 1 \- 1 \= 0  
- Remaining Points: 0

| Body | Mind | Spirit |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 3 | 1 | \-1 |

**Archetype Skill**:

- **Sword & Board (3)**  
  *Skirmisher/Soldier & Shield Arts*

**Supplemental Skill**:

- **Athletics (2)**

**Heritage Skills**:

- **Tracking (1)**  
- **Light Sleeper (0)**

## Create Your Archetype

By now, we’ve learned a lot about Joe Shepard, but there’s still key information missing:

- How did he become a fighter?  
- What are his defenses and vital stats?  
- What does it mean to have a "3" next to a skill?  
- Why are we choosing skills without picking a class?

This system doesn’t use predefined classes. Instead, you define your character’s **Archetype**, a unique concept that integrates their skills, attributes, and abilities. For example, Joe Shepard is a **Frontline Skirmisher**, whose Archetype Skill is **Sword & Board**. Below, we’ll answer these questions and outline how Archetypes work.

---

### Choose a Name for Your Character Archetype

The name of your Archetype is functionally inconsequential but helps personalize your character sheet and clarify your role. For Joe, I chose **Frontline Skirmisher**, which reminds me he is skilled with all Skirmisher/Soldier Weapons. Similarly, I named his Archetype Skill **Sword & Board**, representing his proficiency with weapons and shields.

The goal is to simplify and personalize your character sheet, reducing the need to search for information during gameplay.

---

### Character Conceit

Each character must choose one of the following **Character Conceits** as part of their Archetype. This represents how they engage with the world and utilize their skills, powers, or magic:

- **Innate Abilities**: Natural talents or powers that manifest instinctively.  
- **Prepared Abilities**: Skills or powers activated through preparation or rituals.  
- **Learned Abilities**: Abilities gained through study, training, or practice.

#### Innate Abilities

- **Definition**: Powers or skills that emerge without training or preparation.  
- **Description**: These abilities are instinctive and reactive, making them ideal for players who enjoy a fast-paced, improvisational playstyle.

#### Prepared Abilities

- **Definition**: Abilities that require preparation, rituals, or planning to activate.  
- **Description**: These abilities are strategic, offering greater impact but requiring careful setup.

#### Learned Abilities

- **Definition**: Skills and powers honed through training and experience.  
- **Description**: These abilities are reliable and consistent, improving steadily as the character grows.

---

### Archetype Base Scores

#### Archetype Bonus

Your **Archetype Bonus (AB)** is the sum of your Archetype Skill Mastery Level and Archetype Attribute.

#### Archetype Save

Your **Archetype Save (Save)** is your AB \+ 8\.

#### Archetype Defense

Your **Archetype Defense (Defense or DEF)** is your AB \+ 10\. Adversaries must roll (equal to or) higher than your Defense to hit your character.

#### Hit Points

All characters start with **6 Hit Points (HP)**. This value cannot be increased at the time of writing.

#### Damage Thresholds

Damage in this system is categorized by thresholds:

- **Minor Damage (1+ dmg)**: Deals 1 HP.  
- **Moderate Damage (7+ dmg)**: Deals 2 HP.  
- **Severe Damage (13+ dmg)**: Deals 3 HP.  
- **Deadly Damage**: Deals 4 HP.

Thresholds determine HP loss based on the intensity of the attack. Players can raise these scores using Skills and Abilities.

---

### Abilities

Abilities define what your character can do during gameplay. Players create their own Abilities based on their Skills and Attributes, or select from pre-made ones associated with their chosen Skills.

#### Gaining Abilities

You gain Abilities at the **Novice (0)** and **Skilled (3)** Skill Mastery Levels.

#### Augmenting Abilities

You augment Abilities at the **Apprentice (1)** and **Adept (2)** Skill Mastery Levels.

---

### Creating Archetype Abilities

During Character Creation, you gain **two free Abilities** that cost no Effort. These are usually basic attack actions (e.g., melee and ranged attacks) but can be customized.

#### Example: Joe’s Free Abilities

1. **Weapon Strike**  
   **Trigger**: To Hit \+AB  
   **Effect**: Weapon Damage \+STR

#### Journal Entry

*4th of Summer’s Tide, Year 718*  
"I sometimes think about those early days, herding goats in the hills or hauling stone in the city. Back then, I didn’t know what I was capable of. Fighting in the Doge’s company, standing side by side with men and women who know how to hold a line, there’s nothing like it. Maybe I’m not a hero, but I’m good at this. Good enough to dream a little bigger, maybe build something of my own when the fighting is done."
