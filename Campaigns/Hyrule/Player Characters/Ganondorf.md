# Ganondorf

## The Wizard’s Apprentice, Greudo

# Archetype

Ganon stands tall and imposing, his muscular frame making him seem older and stronger than his years. His dark skin, hardened by the desert sun, has a deep, rich tone that contrasts sharply with the golden markings he wears on his arms and around his neck, a sign of his Gerudo heritage. His hair, black and cropped close on the sides, is longer on top, often tied back when in battle or training. His eyes are a striking amber, sharp and calculating, always giving the sense that he's sizing up every situation with a strategist's mind.

He is dressed in a combination of court finery and practical armor—his garments are adorned with desert motifs, in deep reds and browns, with hints of gold. His clothing is lighter in design, suitable for both the heat of the desert and the court’s formalities, but over it, he wears reinforced leather pieces to protect his vital areas. At his back rests his khopesh—a curved, wickedly sharp blade that speaks of his prowess in combat. Though Ganon has the fierce look of someone who has survived the streets, he carries himself with a newfound discipline, the result of his years under the wizard's mentorship. His bearing is that of a young man ready to prove himself, and the intensity in his expression hints at the power within him that has yet to be fully unleashed.

# Conversations

## Ganon’s Monologue to the Wizard

“You came for me, didn’t you? I knew it. I’ve been waiting… maybe not in the way you’d expect, but I knew someone like you would come. Maybe not you, exactly. But someone who could see me for who I really am. For what I could be.

You see, I’ve been having these dreams. Not just once or twice—every night, like a fire I can’t put out. They’re not normal dreams either. They feel real, more real than anything out here on the streets. In the dreams, I’m… older, I think, stronger. There’s this power around me, something I can’t explain but I know it’s mine. It’s like a part of me that hasn’t woken up yet. And it’s… good. It’s light, not dark.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve had to fight for everything. Every meal, every scrap of respect. You learn quickly that the world doesn’t give you anything unless you take it. And I’ve done things, things I’m not proud of, just to survive. But I’m tired of that. I’m tired of having to be the tough one, the one everyone’s scared of, just to make sure they leave me alone. It wears you down. Makes you think maybe that’s all there is. But these dreams—they’re different. They don’t feel like all this fighting, this scrabbling to stay alive. They feel like something better. Like a chance at something bigger than surviving.

And I know I’m meant for more than this. I’m not just some street rat. I’ve known that my whole life. Maybe I didn’t always have the words for it, but I felt it. There’s something in me that doesn’t belong out here. It’s like… it’s like I’ve been waiting for someone to come along and show me what it is. What I’m supposed to be.

Then you showed up. And I know it can’t be a coincidence.

So, yeah, you probably already knew I’d be here, but I’ve known too. Somehow. These streets, this life… it’s not my future. I’m sure of it. Those dreams—they’re showing me a way out. A way to be more than this. And when I look at you, I can tell you see it too. You wouldn’t be standing here if you didn’t.

So, I’ll come with you. Because this? This is my chance. I’m ready to leave this place behind, whatever it takes. Whatever it takes to become who I’m meant to be.”

## Ganon’s Review with the Wizard

Date: The Morning of the New Moon

"Master Kothos, here’s the schedule I’ve worked out for the week."

I handed the parchment to the court wizard, Kothos, who looked over it, his eyes flickering with interest as they skimmed the lines.

"I’ll be studying at sunrise until midday, when I’ll prepare lunch for the both of us. We’ll eat and review the morning’s studies for an hour afterward. Then I’ll return to my studies until dinner at court. After that, it’s meditation, followed by three hours of kopesh training. I’ll also take six hours of free time at my discretion throughout the week."

Kothos gave a small nod but set the parchment down, his brow furrowing ever so slightly. "You’ve done well organizing this, Ganon, but I do have some concerns."

I straightened a little, waiting for what I knew was coming.

"You’ve been devoting more time than necessary to Vidhimancy. I understand your fascination with the magic of the void—its pull is undeniable, especially for someone with your potential. But the void isn’t just a source of power. It’s unpredictable. Dark things dwell within it, and if you’re not careful, evil can slip through and twist your intentions."

I had expected the warning. Kothos had said something similar before, but it still irked me a little. "I’m not careless," I replied, more defensive than I intended. "I’m cautious. I respect the dangers."

Kothos nodded but pressed on. "I know you are, but I’m asking you to take a step back. Focus on balance. Spend less time on Vidhimancy for now. There’s more for you to learn beyond it."

I sighed but didn’t argue. Kothos had always looked out for me, and despite my stubbornness, I trusted him. He wasn’t just my teacher—he was the one who had taken me off the streets when no one else cared. He knew what he was talking about, even if I wasn’t ready to admit it aloud.

He softened a bit, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. "I’ve also noticed you’re spending more time at court these days. Making friends?"

I shrugged. "I know people. Dinner with Zelda is interesting—she’s the only one around here who can keep up with me. She’s quick, sharp. We trade words like it’s a game, and for once, I don’t feel like I’m the only one thinking ahead. She reminds me of the streets, in a way. Always watching, always aware, like she’s five steps ahead of everyone else."

Kothos chuckled. "It’s good to see you getting to know the Princess better. She’s wise beyond her years, much like you."

I nodded, but there was something else on my mind. "I’ve also been sparring with Link."

Kothos’s brow raised in surprise. "The Champion?"

"Yeah." I couldn’t help but smirk. "He’s the only one who can keep up with me in a fight. Everyone else is either too slow or too sloppy. But him? He’s something else. It’s strange—he moves like he’s spent his life with a sword in hand, but you try talking to him after the match…" I laughed under my breath. "Worst conversationalist I’ve ever met. I’ll throw a joke at him and he just stares at me like I’m speaking a foreign language."

Kothos shook his head, amused. "Not everyone’s as quick with words as you are, Ganon. But it’s good that you’re forging these relationships. Zelda and Link are important—not just to the kingdom, but to you as well. These connections will serve you far better than any magic from the void."

I sighed, knowing he was right. "I suppose. But it's the void that calls to me. The sword is one thing. Sparring is fun, but there’s something more in the shadows of Vidhimancy that’s harder to shake."

Kothos nodded but kept his gaze firm. "Balance, Ganon. You have time for everything, if you’re careful. Now, before I forget." He reached into his robes and pulled out a small pouch, tossing it to me. The familiar jingle of Rupees rang out as I caught it. “Your five Rupee allowance for the week. Use it wisely."

I rolled my eyes but tucked the pouch into my belt. "Five Rupees. Barely enough for a proper meal, but I’ll make do."

Kothos chuckled again, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "I’m sure you will. Just remember, there’s more to life than study and power. Explore those relationships, Ganon. They might surprise you."

As I turned to leave, I couldn’t help but think that Kothos was right. Maybe I was focusing too much on what lay in the shadows. Maybe the Princess and the Champion could offer something I hadn’t yet realized. But still, the call of Vidhimancy lingered in the back of my mind, like a whisper from a place I was meant to explore.
