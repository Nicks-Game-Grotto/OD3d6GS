### **Natural Born Heritages**

The heritages above encompass all of the natural born races of Stereotera. Each has deep roots tied to the Primordial Dragons or the intricate workings of the world’s natural and cultural evolution. Whether shaped by environment, tradition, or unique societal challenges, these heritages provide players with a rich tapestry of options for creating characters who feel authentically tied to the world.

---

### **Coming Next Week: Magical Lineages for Customization**

Magical Lineages allow players to build upon the natural heritages with extraordinary traits, reflecting ancestral or personal connections to powerful magical forces. These lineages expand the possibilities for character creation, offering ways to blend natural origins with unique, supernatural abilities.

#### **Dragonborn (Half-Dragon, Dragonkin)**  
A remnant of the Lost Age, Dragonborn characters descend from ancestors who directly interacted with a True Dragon. This interaction altered their lineage forever. Born from an egg instead of a womb, Dragonborn are as much a testament to the might of the 12 True Dragons as they are a living link to the divine power that once roamed freely.

- **Customization Options:** Adds draconic traits such as elemental breath weapons, scaled skin, and the ability to channel the primal essence of a True Dragon ancestor.

#### **Diamonic (Tiefling and Celestial Types)**  
Diamonic characters are similarly marked by divine or infernal ancestry, connected to the Lost Gods who no longer walk the world. Unlike Dragonborn, their birth is natural, but their traits—be it radiant halos or abyssal horns—set them apart as living reminders of divine intervention.

- **Customization Options:** Includes celestial and infernal traits, such as radiant auras, shadowy teleportation, or resistance to elemental forces tied to the divine.

#### **Ferals (Shape-Changers)**  
Ferals are products of magical or biological experimentation in ages past, their forms reflecting the primal essence of beasts. These traits—whether claws, fur, or the ability to change shape—are regarded as abominations by the faithful, and new Ferals are universally outlawed. 

- **Customization Options:** Allows for bestial traits like heightened senses, animalistic transformations, and abilities tied to specific beasts, offering players a broad range of options to explore.

#### **Elementals (Genasi/Jinn)**  
A relatively new phenomenon, Elementals are children born with traits tied to the classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth. Their existence remains a mystery, with many considering them miracles or signs of change. 

- **Customization Options:** Provides elemental affinities such as control over fire, manipulation of earth, or the ability to breathe underwater, perfect for characters wanting a connection to the raw forces of nature.

#### **Necromantics (Cheating Death)**  
Those who choose Necromantic lineages are individuals who have transcended death itself. Through rituals, technology, or other means, they have reclaimed life—or at least a semblance of it. This is the only legal path for characters to gain magical traits in Stereotera, but public opinion is shifting against them.

- **Customization Options:** Enables characters to explore undead traits, such as regenerative abilities, ethereal resistance, or the ability to wield life-draining powers.
