## Background

Hunter Rosenbree has always been fascinated by the ecosystems of the world, especially how different environments sustain life. As an Ecologist and Travel Journalist, Hunter documents food sources, digestive systems, and survival strategies across cultures and species. Their work is both scientific and personal, as they’ve learned to communicate with their internal biomass—a unique skill that allows them to explore their own biology and push the limits of adaptability. Hunter’s articles and sketches capture the beauty and complexity of the natural world, earning them respect among academics and adventurers alike, even if their work is sometimes dismissed as eccentric.

### Crew Hook

Hunter reconnected with Joe in Port Reckless after their research brought them back to the Artisan Isles. They quickly found common ground with the rest of the crew through shared jobs and a mutual need for funding. Hunter’s curiosity about the world and their unique perspective on life make them an invaluable observer, even if their experimental tendencies occasionally make the others nervous.

### Contacts

**Faro Kelso** *Knowledgeable Ally* - Faro, a Halfling herbalist who runs a small apothecary in Port Reckless. Known for their vast knowledge of local flora, Faro often shares rare ingredients and research tips with Hunter in exchange for field samples from Hunter's travels. The two bond over their mutual respect for nature and its hidden wonders.

**Rethik Tarn** *Indifferent Supplier* - Rethik, a gruff Deep Elf dockmaster, oversees the shipment of exotic goods in and out of Port Reckless. Though he has little interest in Hunter’s work, he often provides access to rare biological samples and artifacts—for a steep price. Hunter tolerates Rethik’s brusque attitude for the sake of their research, knowing his connections are invaluable.

## Heritage

**Coastal Orc**
Hunter Rosenbree’s Coastal Orc heritage reflects their upbringing in an anarchist trade port, where diverse cultures and ideas converged. Raised amidst the rhythms of the sea and the vibrant exchanges of the marketplace, Hunter developed a natural talent for storytelling, weaving tales of exploration and wonder that captivate audiences. Their ancestry also grants them a unique Elemental Attunement—a genetic adaptation tied to their internal biomass. This connection allows them to manipulate and communicate with their own biological processes, a trait that has become the cornerstone of their ecological studies and self-discovery.

## Notes and Records

### Journal

#### *3rd of Highwater, 131 OtU*

> Today, Joe introduced me to two new companions for our upcoming venture. Hollalee Withrethen, a half-elf with an almost exhausting enthusiasm, seems eager to prove herself. She spoke of Vitalix energy with confidence, though I get the sense that her words are as much for her own reassurance as ours. There’s a spark in her—one that could either light the way or burn too brightly if not tempered.  
>
> Then there’s Jaya, a towering bugbear who radiates an easy warmth. She has the kind of presence that makes you feel safe, like she’s already considered every threat in the room and dismissed them with a quiet certainty. When she mentioned her family back in the mountains, her voice carried a depth that made me wonder how many others rely on her strength.  
>
>Joe seems comfortable with both of them, which says something. He’s not one to waste time on people he doesn’t trust. As for me, I’ll watch, listen, and let the dynamics play out. First impressions are rarely the full story, and I’d like to see who they are once the tides get rough.
