# Jaya

***Big Hearted Bad Ass Mama** Learned Spiritual Abilities*
**Portrait:** ![Portrait 1](#) ![Token](#)

## Background

Jaya, a Mountain Bugbear and mother of 72 children, is a warm, gregarious presence in any room. She grew up in a tightly knit mountain community where kindness and cooperation were essential for survival, shaping her ability to charm and inspire others effortlessly. Her maternal instincts extend beyond her biological family, making her a natural caretaker for those in need. Jaya’s knack for using kindness as a tool to achieve her goals has earned her the nickname “Mother of the Isles” among those in Port Reckless, where her generosity is both admired and underestimated.

### Crew Hook

Jaya sees the crew as both a means to an end and a surrogate family. While her kind heart keeps the group together during tense moments, she is deeply motivated by her dream of building wealth to uplift her tribe and provide a better future for her children. Her family back home doesn’t understand her ambitions, but Jaya believes that by succeeding with this group, she can prove that her path, though unconventional, will bring prosperity to her community. Her loyalty and hope for their shared success keep her grounded, even as Hollalee’s schemes pull them into unpredictable situations.

### Contacts

**Port Reckless Contact**  
**Name:** *Rukna Copperclaw*  
**Type:** *Trustworthy Confidant*  
Rukna, a retired Mountain Bugbear sailor, runs a modest tavern near the Port Reckless docks. Known for her sharp wit and unwavering honesty, she offers Jaya advice and a safe place to regroup when the crew’s ventures get too chaotic. Rukna admires Jaya’s ambition and is one of the few who understands her vision for uplifting her tribe, often offering words of encouragement over a hearty meal and a tankard of ale.

**Swamp Port Contact**  
**Name:** *Fenhollow Garett*  
**Type:** *Shrewd Swamp Trader*  
Fenhollow is a Human swamp trader who operates a floating market in the murky waters of a small Artesian Island port. Jaya worked with Fenhollow during her early adventures, helping him defend his market from bandits in exchange for supplies. Though his trust doesn’t come easily, Fenhollow respects Jaya’s resourcefulness and occasionally provides her with rare goods or information, albeit always at a price that favors him more than her.

## Heritage

**Mountain Bugbear**
Jaya’s Mountain Bugbear heritage reflects her life in a close-knit, resourceful community nestled in the rugged mountains. Known for her physical strength, honed from a life of lifting and caring for her many children, she is capable of performing incredible feats of endurance and power. Her early adventures in the swampy regions of the Artisan Islands introduced her to the natural world’s bounty, giving her a practical knowledge of medicinal herbs and their uses. This combination of strength and herbal expertise makes Jaya a nurturing and formidable presence, equally at home carrying heavy loads or tending to the wounded.

Instructions for Choosing Equipment
When selecting your character’s equipment, consider how their background and skills influence their starting possessions. Equipment should reflect their lifestyle, financial standing, and role in the party while balancing what they can carry, have ready, or store.

1. Ready, Carried, and Stored Items
Your character’s equipment is divided into three categories:
Ready Items: Essential tools or weapons your character uses frequently and keeps immediately accessible. Example: a weapon, armor, or a key utility item.
Carried Items: Items that are useful but not immediately needed. These are typically stored in a bag or pouch. Example: rations, rope, or a writing kit.
Stored Items: Possessions kept in a safe location, such as a rented room, ship locker, or family home. These may include heirlooms, additional money, or bulk supplies.

2. Background and Financial Standing
Background determines the type and quality of items your character starts with:
Wealthy or Noble Backgrounds: High-quality equipment but fewer necessities. They may have expensive clothing or heirlooms but store their wealth rather than carry it.
Working-Class or Specialist Backgrounds: Practical and durable gear suited to their trade. For example, a corsair might have well-made sailing gloves, rope, and a reliable weapon.
Humble or Struggling Backgrounds: Basic but functional gear, often with sentimental value or clever improvisation to make up for a lack of resources.

3. Skills
Equip items that support your character’s abilities and skills:
Combat Skills: Choose weapons or armor that match your style and proficiency. For example, a character skilled with whips might carry a high-quality whip and lightweight armor.
Utility Skills: Tools and items tied to your character’s specialties. For example:
Acrobatics: Lightweight gear like climbing tools or grappling hooks.
Crafting or Knowledge Skills: Items like alchemical kits, books, or artisan tools.
Supportive Roles: Include utility items like healing potions, first aid kits, or support gear.

4. Financial Constraints and Needs
Ready Items: Reflect the essentials your character cannot do without.
Carried Items: Consider the character’s profession and role in the party to determine practical additions.
Stored Possessions: Reflect their financial standing and the potential to acquire better equipment or supplies later.

5. Collaborate with Your GM
Discuss with your GM to ensure your equipment aligns with the campaign setting. They can provide:

Insights into what items might be available or restricted.
Suggestions for starting gear based on the campaign environment.
Adjustments for unique character concepts or scenarios.

Final Note
Balance your character’s practicality with storytelling. A character’s equipment is not just a list of items—it reflects who they are, where they come from, and how they’re preparing for their journey. Think about quality, quantity, and accessibility while keeping gameplay needs in mind.
