<!-- Cover Page 1
Players may start with a character name and archetype if they already have a concept in mind. Alternatively, they can complete other sections of the character sheet and decide on the name and archetype afterward. This approach allows the character’s abilities and background to inform these choices. -->
# Caebel “Say” Tinnybrass

***Tiny Shinobi** Prepared Physical Abilities*
**Portrait:** ![Portrait 1](#) ![Token](#)

## Background

Caebel "Sae" Tinnybrass grew up on the outskirts of a bustling trade hub, where cunning and quick thinking were the keys to survival. A natural charmer and skilled thief, Sae honed their talents pulling small-time heists and elaborate cons. Their partnership with Sift, a Crystal Soul Automaton, elevated their schemes, blending Sift's methodical precision with Sae's creative improvisation. By the time they arrived in Port Reckless, their reputation for bold (and sometimes reckless) ingenuity preceded them. For Sae, the crew is an opportunity to expand their reach and make a name as a legendary figure in the Corsair Trade Corporation.

### Crew Hook

Sae fell into the crew after their talent for infiltration saved an otherwise botched job. Their charm and resourcefulness quickly earned them a place among the group, especially as Hollalee seemed drawn to their bold style. Sae treats the crew as both family and audience, relying on their quick thinking and sharper tongue to keep everyone on their toes. Wherever Sae goes, their enigmatic partner Sift follows.

### Contacts

**Port Reckless Contact**  
**Name:** *Fennic "Flick" Draelin*  
**Type:** *Reckless Smuggler*  
Fennic is a Cybrixian smuggler who operates out of the Artisan Islands, ferrying illicit tech and rare goods from Cybrixia to the southern territories. Sae first crossed paths with Flick during a heist that required smuggling stolen schematics off the mainland. The two bonded over a shared taste for risk and a disdain for authority. Flick is unpredictable but loyal to Sae, occasionally offering access to Cybrixian tech or an escape route when things go sideways—for a cut of the profits, of course.

**Cybrixian Contact**  
**Name:** *Elyra Synnovane*  
**Type:** *Ambitious Hacker*  
Elyra is a rising figure within Cybrixia’s underground resistance against the Hive-Mind, specializing in bypassing Synovate systems. Sae’s natural talent for stealth and adaptability caught Elyra’s eye during a Cybrixian job, and the two forged a partnership. While Elyra stays rooted in the neon-lit shadows of Cybrixia, she occasionally reaches out to Sae for help with sensitive operations, offering technical assistance or insider information in return. Their relationship is built on mutual respect, though Elyra’s intensity sometimes unnerves Sae. 

## Heritage

Caebel "Sae" Tinnybrass hails from Cybrixia, where technology and society are seamlessly intertwined under the control of the Hive-Mind. As a Tech Gnome, Sae possesses an innate affinity for patterns and systems, honed in the neon-lit chaos of the Synovate’s domain. This skill manifests in *Pattern Recognition*, allowing Sae to identify subtle, repeating elements in movements, systems, and data—whether predicting guard patrols, deciphering encrypted codes, or finding flaws in mechanical constructs.  
Sae’s Cybrixian origin also grants them a *Telepathic Link* with other technologically enhanced beings, like their partner Sift. This connection is subtle but invaluable, enabling quick, silent communication and a heightened sense of synchronization during high-stakes situations. While Sae has rejected the Hive-Mind’s oppressive control, their heritage has left them with an undeniable connection to technology and its potential, making them a versatile and cunning operator in the ever-evolving world of *Stereotera*.

Characters have Domain Bonuses for Body, Mind, and Spirit. This bonus equals half the sum of the two chosen attributes in that Domain, rounded up. This Domain bonus is used for checks and saves that fall under the Domain but aren’t specific to a single attribute and don't combine with skills.
Players choose character attributes. New players should choose from the list below.

Body
Description: Represents physical aspects, such as strength, agility, and endurance, impacting combat, health, and physical challenges.
Strength (STR): Physical power.
Agility (AGI): Speed and nimbleness. Bodily coordination.
Dexterity (DEX): Precision, especially where hand-eye coordination is concerned.
Beauty (BEA): Influence over the perceiver or likeability based on physical appearance.
Constitution (CON): Endurance and health.

Mind
Description: Encompasses cognitive abilities like reasoning, awareness, and mental clarity, influencing problem-solving and decision-making.
Intelligence (MEN): Reasoning/Memory.
Mindfulness (MIN): Personal Awareness/Mental Clarity.
Perception (PER): External Sensory Acuity/Interpretation.
Intuition (INT): Gut Feelings/Quick Judgments.
Discipline (DIS): Impulse Control/Conditioning.

Spirit
Description: Covers the connection between Mind and Body, including emotional intelligence, willpower, and charisma, affecting social interactions and personal resolve.
Charisma (CHA): Influence and likeability based on personality.
Willpower (WIL): Inner strength.
Luck (LCK): Gambling, Fated Rolls.
Empathy (EMP): Emotional intelligence.
Grace (GRA): Composure and elegance.

Players can sort the columns for these tables to suit their liking.

You have 12 points to distribute among your six chosen attributes. Each point raises an attribute’s score by +1. Attributes start at -1. No attribute can be raised higher than +3 at this stage. This limitation ensures system integrity. If the sum of the attribute bonuses equals six you got it right. -6 + 12 = 6

Instructions for Choosing Equipment
When selecting your character’s equipment, consider how their background and skills influence their starting possessions. Equipment should reflect their lifestyle, financial standing, and role in the party while balancing what they can carry, have ready, or store.

1. Ready, Carried, and Stored Items
Your character’s equipment is divided into three categories:
Ready Items: Essential tools or weapons your character uses frequently and keeps immediately accessible. Example: a weapon, armor, or a key utility item.
Carried Items: Items that are useful but not immediately needed. These are typically stored in a bag or pouch. Example: rations, rope, or a writing kit.
Stored Items: Possessions kept in a safe location, such as a rented room, ship locker, or family home. These may include heirlooms, additional money, or bulk supplies.

2. Background and Financial Standing
Background determines the type and quality of items your character starts with:
Wealthy or Noble Backgrounds: High-quality equipment but fewer necessities. They may have expensive clothing or heirlooms but store their wealth rather than carry it.
Working-Class or Specialist Backgrounds: Practical and durable gear suited to their trade. For example, a corsair might have well-made sailing gloves, rope, and a reliable weapon.
Humble or Struggling Backgrounds: Basic but functional gear, often with sentimental value or clever improvisation to make up for a lack of resources.

3. Skills
Equip items that support your character’s abilities and skills:
Combat Skills: Choose weapons or armor that match your style and proficiency. For example, a character skilled with whips might carry a high-quality whip and lightweight armor.
Utility Skills: Tools and items tied to your character’s specialties. For example:
Acrobatics: Lightweight gear like climbing tools or grappling hooks.
Crafting or Knowledge Skills: Items like alchemical kits, books, or artisan tools.
Supportive Roles: Include utility items like healing potions, first aid kits, or support gear.

4. Financial Constraints and Needs
Ready Items: Reflect the essentials your character cannot do without.
Carried Items: Consider the character’s profession and role in the party to determine practical additions.
Stored Possessions: Reflect their financial standing and the potential to acquire better equipment or supplies later.

5. Collaborate with Your GM
Discuss with your GM to ensure your equipment aligns with the campaign setting. They can provide:

Insights into what items might be available or restricted.
Suggestions for starting gear based on the campaign environment.
Adjustments for unique character concepts or scenarios.

Final Note
Balance your character’s practicality with storytelling. A character’s equipment is not just a list of items—it reflects who they are, where they come from, and how they’re preparing for their journey. Think about quality, quantity, and accessibility while keeping gameplay needs in mind.
