# **The Wrathful Shoals: An Account from Elandra Stormsong’s Stolen Journal**

*“To sail into the Shoals is to wager your life against the fickle tides of fortune and folly. Few return, and those who do are marked—haunted by sights no sane soul can comprehend. Still, the Shoals call to those of us who are cursed to crave the horizon. And so, I go.”*  
—Elandra Stormsong, Navigator of Legend

### **Entry 17: The Breath of Drowned Gods**

The sea whispered of death before we even crossed into the Shoals proper. At first, it was a faint shimmer—a deceptive calm that belied the horrors below. Then came the bubbles, vast and translucent, rising from the depths like the last breaths of dying leviathans. When they burst, the waters screamed. The ship pitched violently, pulled toward the yawning maw of a whirlpool that materialized in an instant.  

The crew clung to ropes and rails as if they held the very threads of their lives. I shouted commands, but my voice was lost to the chaos. I swear, in the moments before we escaped its pull, I saw faces in the foam—ancient, mournful, and twisted with rage. The Breath of Drowned Gods, they call it. If gods are truly buried here, I pity the fools who wake them.

### **Entry 18: The Bent Tides**

There is no compass that can guide you through the Shoals, no star reliable enough to navigate by. The Bent Tides see to that.  

We sailed straight for hours—by all accounts, heading west—but found ourselves back where we started, staring at the same jagged outcrop. Time twisted around us. A man swore he’d been aloft in the crow’s nest for mere minutes, yet his hair was white when he descended. Another claimed to have seen the ship swallowed whole by the sea, only to blink and find himself at my side again.  

Even I began to doubt my senses. The horizon bled into itself, the sky shifting in unnatural hues. I am certain we passed ships caught in the same loop, their crews waving at us with despair etched into their faces. Or perhaps they were our own reflections, doomed to drift forever in a fractured reality.

### **Entry 19: The Clawing Deep**

I have heard tales of the horrors that dwell beneath these waters, but nothing could prepare me for the truth.  

It began with a scraping, faint but insistent, like the claws of some vast beast raking against the hull. Then the ship shuddered, and something emerged from the depths—a creature of jagged chitin and glistening flesh, its eyes glowing with malevolent intelligence. It clung to the side of the ship, its limbs too many to count, and screamed a sound that tore through the mind as much as the ears.  

We fought as best we could, but for every beast we drove off, another rose to take its place. When I looked to the cliffs for refuge, I saw them crawling too—with creatures just as monstrous, scaling the jagged rocks like insects. The Clawing Deep, they call it. I wonder if the true horror of these waters is that they are alive and hungry.

### **Entry 20: The Gray Mists**

I loathe the fog more than anything else in the Shoals. It creeps in silently, coiling around the ship like a serpent. The mists hide the shifting sands below, where reefs and shoals rise like the bones of forgotten beasts to tear through unsuspecting hulls.  

The worst of it, though, are the whispers. They come from nowhere and everywhere, voices that sound like crewmates long dead. They call you by name, urging you to step into the gray abyss. Once, I heard my father’s voice—a man dead these ten years—begging me to join him.  

We followed the sound of bells once, thinking it was another ship signaling for aid. When we reached the source, we found only wreckage, and the bells were bones, clattering against each other in the waves.

### **Entry 21: Maldrakhar, The Stormwrought**

The Shoals are not just cursed; they are claimed. At the heart of this watery hell lies **Maldrakhar**, the Stormwrought, the first and most terrible of the True Dragons.  

I have not seen it—thank the gods—but I have felt its presence. The very air grows heavy, charged with a power that makes the skin crawl and the heart race. The seas churn with unnatural fury, waves towering like mountains, their crests flashing with lightning from nowhere.  

Those who have seen Maldrakhar speak of its vastness, its scales like living storms, and its eyes—cold and endless as the abyss itself. It is said that to meet the Stormwrought is to face death made manifest. Yet the Shoals remain its lair, and we, the intruders, must tread lightly or face its wrath.

### **Final Thoughts**  

The Wrathful Shoals are no place for the faint of heart. To cross them is to gamble with forces that defy reason and reality. Yet, for those bold enough to try, the rewards are whispered of in taverns across Stereotera: treasures beyond imagining, the secrets of the Shoals’ ancient wrecks, and the respect of the Corsair Trade Corporation itself.  

But make no mistake—this is no ordinary voyage. The Shoals demand a price, and they always collect. Should you sail these cursed waters, remember this: bravery is no shield against madness, and the sea is both a giver and taker of life.
