# Common Conditions

## Vulnerable
Characters who have the Vulnerable condition have disadvantage on rolls, and rolls against them have advantage. This applies in and out of combat.  
The length of this condition is determined by the effect that causes it.

## Prone
The character is lying on the ground. Melee attackers have advantage when targeting them, while ranged attacks against the prone character are made with disadvantage.  
A prone character must use **Extended Movement** (spending Effort and an action) to stand up and move within their Standard Movement radius. If they choose not to spend Effort, they can only stand up as part of an action, without moving.  
Attacks made with a Firearm, Crossbow, or Blowgun have advantage while prone. Characters trying to hide gain extra advantage while prone.

## Attached
The character is bound or clinging to something, such as a creature, object, or surface. This limits their movement to the thing they are attached to, but the condition is voluntary.  
Characters can control or disrupt the movement of creatures that they are Attached to.

## Bested
The character is mentally or physically defeated in some way. This affects their morale, lowers their ability to fight effectively, or forces them to retreat or submit. Characters can declare the Bested condition on themselves or try to convince adversaries to stand down if they have been bested.

## Unconscious
The character is knocked out, unable to act or react. Attacks against them have advantage, and any melee attacks are treated as Deadly.  
Players make one each Mind, Body, and Spirit save (DC12). If the player fails two or more saves, their character is considered dead.

# Compounding Conditions

## Stunned
The character is temporarily **Incapacitated** until they succeed a Save and Spend an Action. The Stunned Condition ends at the end of their action.

## Grappled
The character is Vulnerable, and movement is reduced to 0, held in place by another creature.  
They can still take actions but must spend Effort and succeed on a Body save to escape.

## Mounted
The character is Attached to a creature or vehicle, gaining increased mobility and other benefits from their mount's speed and capabilities. Characters can mount creatures or people if they are one size larger or suffering the Prone condition.  
The condition also applies if a character has pinned a prone adversary with their body. The target is Grappled, and both parties' movement becomes 0 ft.

## Distracted
The character is temporarily Incapacitated. This condition can also make characters more vulnerable to surprise attacks or environmental hazards.  
This condition does not require a Save and ends at the start of their next action.

## Bind
Either attacker or defender can choose to Spend Effort and Bind as part of an attack when the target is the same size, and the attack hits but fails to do HP damage during Melee Combat.  
This is a combat condition that affects both the character and its target. Characters in a bind are Vulnerable and cannot make attacks against targets that are not in the Bind with them. Players must Spend Effort and an Action to disengage from the Bind. A Bind Condition ends if either character becomes Stunned, Distracted, Frightened, or Incapacitated in any way.  
Characters in a Bind are in danger of becoming Grappled.

## Incapacitated
The character cannot make attack actions or effectively defend themselves. They may remain conscious but are otherwise unable to influence the battle or situation directly. Movement is reduced to Close or Very Close Range based on the circumstance.  
Incapacitated creatures are considered Bested, unless the trigger effect states that the condition is temporary.  
An Incapacitated creature needs to be healed to end the condition, unless the trigger effect states that the condition is temporary.

## Restrained
The character's movement is restricted by the circumstances of the effect. The character is Vulnerable and automatically fails Body Saves.  
This condition applies if:
- A creature is tied, chained, or otherwise involuntarily Attached to an immovable object.
- A creature has no effort to end the Grapple Condition.  
Players must take specific actions associated with escape skills or declare they are Bested to end the condition.

## Frightened
The character is scared of a specific target and cannot willingly move closer to it. They are also Vulnerable while the source of fear is within line of sight.  
Players must Save to end this condition.
